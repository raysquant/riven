**PROSPECTUS SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights selected information contained elsewhere in this
prospectus. This summary does not contain all of the information you should
consider before investing in our Class  A common stock. You should read this
entire prospectus carefully, including the sections titled Risk Factors and
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes
included elsewhere in this prospectus, before making an investment decision.
Our fiscal year ends on January 31. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
references in this prospectus to we, us, our, our company and Zoom
refer to Zoom Video Communications, Inc. Unless otherwise indicated,
references to our common stock include our Class A common stock and Class B
common stock. _

**ZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS, INC.**

Our mission is to make video communications frictionless.

We provide a video-first communications platform that delivers happiness and
fundamentally changes how people interact. We connect people through
frictionless video, voice, chat and content sharing and enable face-to-face
video experiences for thousands of people in a single meeting across disparate
devices and locations. Our cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-
quality video that is easy to use, manage and deploy, provides an attractive
return on investment, is scalable and easily integrates with physical spaces
and applications. We believe that rich and reliable communications lead to
interactions that build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the
trust our customers place in us by delivering a communications solution that
just works. Our goal is to make Zoom meetings better than in-person
meetings.

We believe that our platform transforms how organizations communicate and work
to create opportunities that were not possible before. We are witnessing the
rapid adoption of video communications inside traditional organizations,
enabling far greater effectiveness and intimacy in human-to-human interactions
over a distance. In addition, we are enabling new use cases for how people are
carrying out their work. For example, a technology customer with approximately
1,000 employees has been able to grow and maintain its culture even with an
all-remote employee base by running all of its meetings on Zoom. A hospital,
using Zoom, has been able to reduce the number of and time in surgeries by
connecting specialists live into the operating room. A university uses Zoom to
encourage participation and inclusion for students in its night program who
have family and work constraints that would otherwise prevent them from
participating in class.

We believe that our customers are delighted when they use our platform. Since
our founding in 2011, our platform has been used to conduct tens of billions
of meeting minutes. We believe that our success results from a culture that is
focused on customer and employee happiness, a video-first cloud architecture,
recognized market leadership, viral demand, an efficient go-to-market strategy
and robust customer support.

Our architecture is video-first, cloud-native and optimized to dynamically
process and deliver reliable, high-quality video across devices. Our approach
to video has been substantially different from that taken by others who have
attempted to add video to an aging, pre-existing conference call or chat tool.
We developed a proprietary multimedia router optimized for the cloud that
separates content processing from the transporting and mixing of streams. Our
globally distributed cloud architecture delivers a differentiated user
experience.

The cornerstone of our platform is Zoom Meetings, around which we provide a
full suite of products and features designed to give users a frictionless
communications experience. Users are comprised of both hosts who organize
video meetings and the individual attendees who participate in those video
meetings. Many customers also choose to implement Zoom Rooms, our software-
based conference room system, which enables users to

##### Table of Contents

easily experience Zoom Meetings in their physical meeting spaces. We also
recently launched Zoom Phone, a cloud-based PBX system, which complements Zoom
Meetings. Our robust integrations and partner ecosystem enable organizations
to connect Zoom seamlessly with third-party applications that their employees
already use, reducing friction and increasing employee happiness and
productivity.

The happiness we bring is recognized by customers and industry analysts alike.
In 2018, our average customer Net Promoter Score (NPS) was over 70. Gartner
has named Zoom a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for Meeting Solutions based on
our ability to execute and completeness of vision. Zoom also has
consistently high scores across customer review sites, including Gartner Peer
Insights, TrustRadius and G2 Crowd. We have been recognized as a 2018 Gartner
Peer Insights Customers Choice for Meeting Solutions (Web Conferencing). G2
Crowd recognized Zoom as the leading pacesetter in the industry in its 2018
Momentum Grid of Video Conferencing.

We have a unique model that combines viral enthusiasm for our platform with a
multipronged go-to-market strategy for optimal efficiency. Viral enthusiasm
begins with our users as they experience our platform  it just works. This
enthusiasm continues as meeting participants become paid hosts and as
businesses of all sizes become our customers. Our sales efforts funnel this
viral demand into routes-to-market that are optimized for each customer
opportunity, which can include our direct sales force, online channel,
resellers and strategic partners. Our sales model allows us to efficiently
turn a single non-paying user into a full enterprise deployment. For the
fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, 55% of our 344 customers that contributed
more than $100,000 of revenue started with at least one free host prior to
subscribing. These 344 customers contributed 30% of revenue in the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2019.

We believe that we have built a scalable and sustainable business model. We
have thousands of customers of all sizes across industry verticals and
geographies. We are experiencing rapid revenue growth and are generating
positive cash flow from operations. Much of the primary capital that we have
raised in recent years remains on our balance sheet, demonstrating the cash
flow efficiency of our business. Our revenue was $60.8 million, $151.5 million
and $330.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019,
respectively, representing annual revenue growth of 149% and 118% in fiscal
2018 and fiscal 2019, respectively. We had a net loss of $0.0 million and $3.8
million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively,
and net income of $7.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019.
Cash provided by operations was $9.4 million, $19.4 million and $51.3 million
for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

**Industry Trends in Our Favor**

**_Communication is at the Center of Organizational Performance_**

Communication is fundamental for organizations. High-quality communication
increases happiness throughout teams and, when coupled with strong execution,
can improve business performance. The evolving nature of the modern workforce
has made communication even more important than it has been in the past.

**_Communication and Collaboration Must Evolve as the Nature of Work is
Changing_**

The way people work is changing. Organizations must evolve their approach to
communication and collaboration in response to the following trends:



  |  |   |

**_Employees are increasingly distributed_**. Historically, teams were
physically located together, even in the largest organizations, to drive
productivity. Mobile and cloud technologies and ubiquitous network
connectivity have enabled modern organizations to be increasingly distributed.  
  
---|---|---|---

##### Table of Contents

  |  |   |

**_Organizations seek to drive deeper engagement with employees, customers and
partners_** _._ People derive more personal satisfaction and are more
productive when they engage at a deeper level across internal and external
business relationships. With increasingly distributed workforces, maintaining
this level of engagement is difficult. Video is a rich form of interaction as
it allows the communication of facial expressions, emotions, body language and
the surrounding environment. However, the lack of reliable business solutions
has limited the adoption of video in the workplace.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Workforce demographics are changing._** Shifting demographics alongside
increasingly distributed workforces increase the need for effective ways to
communicate beyond in-person meetings. For example, millennials currently make
up 35% of the U.S. workforce. This population values agility and flexibility
in their work environment, and millennials expect technology to meet their
needs and work seamlessly.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Employees are influencing IT decisions_** _._ Employees are increasingly
the primary force for IT modernization at work as they bring the latest
technologies from their personal lives to their jobs. Employees often expect
to seamlessly communicate on any device and across mediums and, as a result,
are increasingly influencing IT decisions.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
**_Organizations Need a Comprehensive Platform that Enables Modern
Communication_**

Legacy approaches to workplace communication have failed to address the
evolving nature of work. Legacy communication tools have been ineffective due
to substandard technology, expensive deployments, complicated interfaces and
aging, proprietary architectures. This dynamic has resulted in organizations
deploying disparate and siloed technologies to address each of the various
ways in which people communicate, including video, voice, email, chat and
content sharing. These disparate technologies are difficult for employees to
adopt and navigate and cumbersome and expensive for IT to support and manage.

To effectively enable modern communication, a comprehensive platform must have
the following qualities:



  |  |   |

**_Reliable, high-quality communications_** _._ Organizations have a
significant need for a platform that reliably delivers high-quality video and
voice, even with varying levels of network performance.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Easy to use_** _._ To drive broad adoption, a platforms user interface
must be intuitive and easily navigable. In addition, users want solutions that
have feature parity across devices and seamlessly integrate with their
calendars, contacts and overall workflows.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Easy to deploy and manage_** _._ Organizations want a single platform that
is easy to deploy, leverages existing network infrastructure and conference
room hardware and is simple to manage at scale through an intuitive
administrative console and reporting system.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Attractive return on investment_** _._ Organizations want a single platform
that not only reduces the costs of proprietary infrastructure and conference
room investments but also provides other opportunities for further cost
savings, such as reducing unnecessary and expensive business travel.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Scalability_** _._ Organizations need a communications platform that can be
optimized for their footprint and scales as they grow.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Integrated._** Organizations need a platform that integrates with their
physical workspaces and existing business applications.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Flexible terms_** _._ Organizations also want to purchase technology under
flexible terms that are right-sized for their business needs.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
**Our Platform**

We provide a video-first communications platform that delivers happiness and
fundamentally changes how people interact by connecting them through
frictionless video, voice, chat and content sharing. Our cloud-native

platform enables face-to-face video experiences and connects thousands of
users across disparate devices and locations in a single meeting. We strive to
make Zoom meetings better than in-person meetings.

Key benefits of our platform include:



  |  |   |

**_Reliable, high-quality communications that enable productivity,
connectedness and trust._** Our platform delivers a high-quality, reliable
communications experience across devices even with varying bandwidths and
network performance. In fact, our platform can continue to deliver a
productive meeting experience even with up to 40% packet loss.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Easy to use._** We provide a consolidated, intuitive interface for video,
voice, chat and content sharing that can be easily navigated even by first
time users. We enable calendar integration, easy synchronization with
conference room equipment and feature parity across devices.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Easy to deploy and manage._** Our cloud-native platform is easy to deploy
and manage by both IT administrators and business users, even when integrating
with existing infrastructure. Our platform removes the need for the
integration of disparate communications tools, product-specific knowledge and
high-touch user support and troubleshooting.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Attractive return on investment_** **.** Our platform drives higher
employee engagement and improved collaboration, resulting in increased
organizational productivity. Switching to our platform also reduces the costs
associated with expensive on-premises infrastructure and continual
maintenance.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Scalability._** Our cloud-native platform was purpose-built to scale with
organizations as they grow in size and complexity. Our platform delivers the
highest quality experience for organizations of all sizes and for meetings,
whether with two or thousands of users.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Integrated._** Our platform integrates with cloud software applications
provided by companies such as Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft,
salesforce.com, Slack and others. We also have an ecosystem of hardware
partners through which we deploy our Zoom Rooms and Conference Room Connector
offerings.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Flexible terms._** Customers can subscribe to our communications platform
based on the number of hosts that they require on a month-to-month basis or
purchase one- to multi-year subscriptions.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages that will enable us
to maintain and extend our leadership in communications. Our competitive
strengths include:



  |  |   |

**_Video-first cloud architecture._** We built our platform from the ground up
to be cloud-native and video-first, unlike other approaches that have
attempted to add video to an aging, pre-existing conference call or chat tool.
Our unique architecture was built by our talented team, led by a founding
group of engineers who have extensive expertise in real-time communications
technology.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_A recognized market leader_**. We have been recognized by industry analysts
as a market leader.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Viral demand driven by individual users._** Our rapid adoption is driven by
a virtuous cycle of positive user experiences. Individuals typically begin
using our platform when a colleague or associate invites them to a Zoom
meeting. When attendees experience our platform and realize the benefits, they
often become paying customers to unlock additional functionality.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Growing base of happy customers._** We believe that making and keeping
users happy is critical to growing our business. We believe that our customer
NPS, which averaged over 70 in 2018, demonstrates that our high-quality, easy-
to-use platform is making customers happy.  
  
---|---|---|---

##### Table of Contents

  |  |   |

**_Multipronged go-to-market strategy._** We have a multipronged go-to-market
strategy that integrates the viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal
routes-to-market that match the size of the customer opportunity. Our direct
sales force and strategic partners sell to customers of all sizes, and we
leverage our online sales channel for smaller customers.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Robust customer support and success function._** We offer 24/7/365 support
through live chat, phone and video. For the 90-day period ended January 31,
2019, our customer support team had a customer satisfaction score (CSAT) of
over 90%.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
**Our Culture of Happiness**

Our culture of delivering happiness drives our mission, vision and values and
is fundamental to everything we do at Zoom:



  |  |   |

**_Mission_**. Our mission is to make video communications frictionless.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Vision_** _._ Our vision is to empower people to accomplish more through
video communications.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Values_**. We care for our community, our customers, our company, our
teammates and ourselves.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
This culture supports our hiring and serves as a competitive advantage in
attracting and retaining top talent. Our Chief Executive Officer received
Glassdoors #1 CEO of a large company award in 2018, and we placed #2 in
Glassdoors Best Places to Work in the large company category in 2019.

**Our Market Opportunity**

Video has increasingly become the way that individuals want to communicate in
the workplace and their daily lives. As a result, it has become a fundamental
component of todays communication and collaboration market, which also
includes integrated voice, chat and content sharing. IDC has defined this
market as Unified Communications and Collaboration. Within this market, we
address the Hosted / Cloud Voice and Unified Communications, Collaborative
Applications and IP Telephony Lines segments. IDC estimated that these
segments combined represent a $43.1 billion opportunity in 2022.

We believe we address a broader opportunity than is currently captured in
third-party market research because once our customers begin to experience the
benefits of our video-first communications platform, they tend to greatly
expand their use of video throughout their organizations. As a result, we
expect that use of our platform will significantly increase the penetration of
video communications across a broad range of customer types and use cases. We
believe that all of todays information workers could benefit from our
platforms ability to connect people through frictionless video, voice, chat
and content sharing.

**Our Growth Strategy**

We focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth:



  |  |   |

keep our existing customers happy;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

drive new customer acquisition;

**Summary Risk Factors**

Our business is subject to numerous risks, as more fully described in the
section titled Risk Factors immediately following this prospectus summary.
These risks include, among others:



  |  |   |

Our business depends on our ability to attract new customers and hosts, retain
and upsell additional products to existing customers and upgrade free hosts to
our paid offerings. Any decline in new customers and hosts, renewals or
upgrades would harm our business;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

We have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our
prospects and future results of operations;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

We operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete
effectively;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

We may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

Interruptions, delays or outages in service from our co-located data centers
and a variety of other factors would impair the delivery of our services,
require us to issue credits or pay penalties and harm our business;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

Failures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access
could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are
unreliable, possibly leading our customers and hosts to switch to our
competitors or to cancel their subscriptions to our platform;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

As we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles could lengthen,
and we could experience greater deployment challenges;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

We generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any
decline in demand for our platform or for communications and collaboration
technologies in general would harm our business;  
  
---|---|---|---

**Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company**

As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our last fiscal
year, we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) enacted in April 2012. An emerging growth
company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are
otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are
not limited to:



  |  |   |

not being required to comply for a certain period of time with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act);  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our
periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

exemptions from the requirements of holding a stockholder advisory vote on
executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously
approved.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
We may take advantage of these provisions until the last day of our fiscal
year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our
Class A common stock in this offering. However, if certain events occur prior
to the end of such five-year period, including if (i) we become a large
accelerated filer, with at least $700 million of equity securities held by
non-affiliates; (ii) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion; or (iii)
we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year
period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of
such five-year period.

We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure
obligations in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part
and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in
future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our
stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public
reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.

In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take
advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised
accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to
delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would
otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail
ourselves of this exemption, and, therefore, we will be subject to the same
new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not
emerging growth companies.

The holders of our outstanding Class B common stock will hold 99.0% of the
voting power of our outstanding capital stock following this offering and the
concurrent private placement, with our directors, executive officers and 5%
stockholders and their respective affiliates holding 61.6% of such voting
power in the aggregate. These holders will have the ability to control the
outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the
election of our directors and the approval of any change of control
transaction. See the section titled Description of Capital Stock for
additional information.

Use of proceeds

|    |

We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of our Class A common stock
that we are offering and the concurrent private placement will be
approximately $434.5 million (or approximately $541.5 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full), based on the
initial public offering price of $36.00 per share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses related to the
offering and the concurrent private placement.



We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering and
the concurrent private placement for general corporate purposes, including
working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. We may also use
a portion of the net proceeds for acquisitions or strategic investments in
complementary businesses, products, services or technologies, although we do
not currently have any plans or commitments for any such acquisitions or
investments. See the section titled Use of Proceeds for additional
information. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Class
A common stock by the selling stockholders.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Investing in our Class  A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You
should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below,
together with all of the other information in this prospectus, including the
section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and
related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock.
Our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could
also be harmed by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us
or that we currently believe are not material. If any of the risks actually
occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects
could be materially and adversely affected. Unless otherwise indicated,
references to our business being harmed in these risk factors will include
harm to our business, platform, reputation, brand, financial condition,
results of operations and future prospects. In such event, the market price of
our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your
investment._

**Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry**

**_Our business depends on our ability to attract new customers and hosts,
retain and upsell additional products to existing customers and upgrade free
hosts to our paid offerings. Any decline in new customers and hosts, renewals
or upgrades would harm our business._**

Our business depends upon our ability to attract new customers and hosts and
maintain and expand our relationships with our customers and hosts, including
upselling additional products to our existing customers and upgrading hosts to
a paid Zoom Meeting plan. A host is any user of our video-first communications
platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting and invites one or more participants to
join that meeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting plan
as paid hosts. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying
entity, which can be a single paid host or an organization of any size
(including a distinct unit of an organization) that has multiple paid hosts.

Our business is subscription based, and customers are not obligated to and may
not renew their subscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire. As a
result, we cannot provide assurance that customers will renew their
subscriptions utilizing the same tier of their Zoom Meeting plan, upgrade to a
higher-priced tier or purchase additional products, if they renew at all.
Renewals of subscriptions to our platform may decline or fluctuate because of
several factors, such as dissatisfaction with our products and support, a
customer or host no longer having a need for our products, or the perception
that competitive products provide better or less expensive options. In
addition, some customers downgrade their Zoom Meeting plan or do not renew
their subscriptions. We must continually add new customers and hosts to grow
our business beyond our current user base and to replace customers and hosts
who choose not to continue to use our platform. Any decrease in user
satisfaction with our products or support would harm our brand, word-of-mouth
referrals and ability to grow.

We encourage customers to purchase additional products and encourage hosts to
upgrade to our paid offerings by recommending additional features and through
in-product prompts and notifications. Additionally, we seek to expand within
organizations by adding new hosts, having workplaces purchase additional
products, or expanding the use of Zoom into other teams and departments within
an organization. At the same time, we strive to demonstrate the value of our
platform and various product offerings to those hosts that subscribe to our
free Zoom Meeting plan, thereby encouraging them to upgrade to a paid Zoom
Meeting plan. However, a majority of these hosts may never upgrade to a paid
Zoom Meeting plan. If we fail to upsell our customers or upgrade hosts of our
free Zoom Meeting plan to a paid subscription or expand the number of paid
hosts within organizations, our business would be harmed.

In addition, our user growth rate may slow in the future as our market
penetration rates increase and we turn our focus to upgrading our free hosts
to a paid Zoom Meeting plan rather than growing the total number of users. If
we are not able to continue to expand our user base or fail to upgrade our
free hosts to a paid Zoom Meeting plan, our revenue may grow more slowly than
expected or decline.

**_We have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate
our prospects and future results of operations._**

We were incorporated in 2011. As a result of our limited operating history,
our ability to forecast our future results of operations is limited and
subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and
model future growth. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered
indicative of our future performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue
growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons,
including any reduction in demand for our platform, increased competition,
contraction of our overall market, our inability to accurately forecast demand
for our platform and plan for capacity constraints or our failure, for any
reason, to capitalize on growth opportunities. We have encountered and will
encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies
in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described
herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we
use to plan our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address
these risks successfully, our business would be harmed.

**_We operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete
effectively._**

The market for communication and collaboration technologies platforms is
competitive and rapidly changing. Certain features of our current platform
compete in the communication and collaboration technologies market with
products offered by:



  |  |   |

legacy web-based meeting providers, including Webex and Skype for Business;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

bundled productivity solutions providers with basic video functionality,
including Google; and  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

point solutions providers, including LogMeIn.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
Other large established companies like Amazon and Facebook have in the past
and may in the future also make investments in video communications tools. In
addition, as we introduce new products and services, and with the introduction
of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in
the future. For example, we recently introduced Zoom Phone, a cloud phone
system that will allow customers to replace their existing private branch
exchange solution, in the future, which will result in increased competition
against companies that offer similar services and new competitors that may
enter that market in the future. Further, many of our actual and potential
competitors benefit from competitive advantages over us, such as greater name
recognition, longer operating histories, more varied products and services,
larger marketing budgets, more established marketing relationships, third-
party integration, greater accessibility across devices or applications,
access to larger user bases, major distribution agreements with hardware
manufacturers and resellers, and greater financial, technical and other
resources. Some of our competitors may make acquisitions or enter into
strategic relationships to offer a broader range of products and services than
we do. These combinations may make it more difficult for us to compete
effectively. We expect these trends to continue as competitors attempt to
strengthen or maintain their market positions.

Demand for our platform is also price sensitive. Many factors, including our
marketing, user acquisition and technology costs, and our current and future
competitors pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly affect our
pricing strategies. Certain competitors offer, or may in the future offer,
lower-priced or free products or services that compete with our platform or
may bundle and offer a broader range of products and services. Similarly,
certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire
customers at a lower cost than we can. Furthermore, third parties could build
products similar to ours that rely on open source software. Even if such
products do not include all the features and functionality that our platform
provides, we could face pricing pressure from these third parties to the
extent that users find such alternative products to be sufficient to meet
their video communications needs. There can be no assurance that we will not
be forced to engage in price-cutting initiatives or other discounts or to
increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain customers in
response to competitive pressures, either of which would harm our business.

**_We may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future._**

We have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods. You should
not rely on the revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual period as an
indication of our future performance. We expect our revenue growth rate to
decline in future periods. Many factors may contribute to declines in our
growth rate, including higher market penetration, increased competition,
slowing demand for our platform, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on
growth opportunities and the maturation of our business, among others. If our
growth rate declines, investors perceptions of our business and the trading
price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.

**_Interruptions, delays or outages in service from our co-located data
centers and a variety of other factors would impair the delivery of our
services, require us to issue credits or pay penalties and harm our business.
_**

We currently serve our users from 13 co-located data centers in Australia,
Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands and the United
States. We also utilize Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for the
hosting of certain critical aspects of our business. As part of our
distributed meeting architecture, we establish private links between data
centers that automatically transfer data between various data centers in order
to optimize performance on our platform. Damage to, or failure of, these data
centers has in the past resulted in and could in the future result in
interruptions or delays in our services. In addition, we have experienced, and
may in the future experience, other interruptions and delays in our services
caused by a variety of other factors, including but not limited to
infrastructure changes, vendor issues, human or software errors, viruses,
security attacks, fraud, general internet availability issues, spikes in usage
and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to
identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an
acceptable period of time. For example, in January 2019, we experienced an
outage in our services for less than two hours, which we later determined was
initially caused by a technical issue with one of our vendors. Additionally,
in connection with the addition of new data centers or expansion or
consolidation of our existing data center facilities or other reasons, we may
move or transfer our data and our users metadata to other data centers.
Despite precautions that we take during this process, any unsuccessful data
transfers may impair or cause disruptions in the delivery of our service, and
we may incur significant costs in connection with any such move or transfer.
Interruptions, delays or outages in our services would reduce our revenue, may
require us to issue credits or pay penalties, may subject us to claims and
litigation, may cause customers and hosts to terminate their subscriptions and
adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and hosts. Our ability
to attract and retain customers and hosts depends on our ability to provide
customers and hosts with a highly reliable platform and even minor
interruptions or delays in our services could harm our business.

Additionally, if our data centers are unable to keep up with our increasing
needs for capacity, customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain
additional capacity, which could harm our business.

We do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation
of the co-located data center facilities we use, and they are vulnerable to
damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes,
floods, fires, hurricanes, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware
failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events,
any of which could disrupt our service. In the event of significant physical
damage to one of these data centers, it may take a significant period of time
to achieve full resumption of our services, and our disaster recovery planning
may not account for all eventualities. Despite precautions taken at these
facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism or other
act of malfeasance, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice
or other unanticipated problems at the facilities would harm our business.

**_Failures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access
could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are
unreliable, possibly leading our customers and hosts to switch to our
competitors or to cancel their subscriptions to our platform._**

Unlike traditional communications and collaborations technologies, our
services depend on our users high-speed broadband access to the internet,
usually provided through a cable or digital subscriber line connection.



15

* * *

##### Table of Contents

Increasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade
the performance of our platform due to capacity constraints and other internet
infrastructure limitations. As our number of users grows and their usage of
communications capacity increases, we will be required to make additional
investments in network capacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds,
the availability of which may be limited, or the cost of which may be on terms
unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity is not available to us as our user
base grows, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high
data transmission capacity, reliability or performance. In addition, if
internet service providers and other third parties providing internet services
have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our users will not
have access to our platform or may experience a decrease in the quality of our
platform. Furthermore, as the rate of adoption of new technologies increases,
the networks our platform relies on may not be able to sufficiently adapt to
the increased demand for these services, including ours. Frequent or
persistent interruptions could cause current or potential users to believe
that our systems or platform are unreliable, leading them to switch to our
competitors or to avoid our platform, and could permanently harm our business.

In addition, users who access our platform through mobile devices, such as
smartphones and tablets, must have a high-speed connection, such as 3G, 4G or
LTE, satellite or Wi-Fi to use our services and applications. Currently, this
access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market
power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent
phone companies, cable companies, satellite companies and wireless companies.
Some of these providers offer products and subscriptions that directly compete
with our own offerings, which can potentially give them a competitive
advantage. Also, these providers could take measures that degrade, disrupt or
increase the cost of user access to third-party services, including our
platform, by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to
support or facilitate third-party services or by charging increased fees to
third parties or the users of third-party services, any of which would make
our platform less attractive to users and reduce our revenue.

On January 4, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released an
order reclassifying broadband internet access as an information service,
subject to certain provisions of Title I of the Communications Act. The order
requires broadband providers to publicly disclose accurate information
regarding network management practices, performance characteristics and
commercial terms of their broadband internet access services sufficient to
enable consumers to make informed choices regarding the purchase and use of
such services and entrepreneurs and other small businesses to develop, market
and maintain internet offerings. The new rules went into effect on June 11,
2018 and are the subject of various appeals and congressional review.
Moreover, a number of states are adopting or considering legislation or
executive actions that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. We
cannot predict whether the FCC order or state initiatives will be modified,
overturned, or vacated by legal action of the court, federal legislation, or
the FCC. Under the new rules, broadband internet access providers may be able
to charge web-based services such as ours for priority access, which could
result in increased costs and a loss of existing customers and hosts, impair
our ability to attract new customers and hosts, and harm our business.

**_As we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles could
lengthen, and we could experience greater deployment challenges._**

As our business evolves, we may need to invest more resources into sales to
large organizations. Large organizations typically undertake a significant
evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organizational
structure and approval requirements, all of which can lengthen our sales
cycle. We may also face unexpected deployment challenges with large
organizations or more complicated deployment of our platform. Large
organizations may demand additional features, support services and pricing
concessions or require additional security management or control features. We
may spend substantial time, effort and money on sales efforts to large
organizations without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales or
that these customers will deploy our platform widely enough across their
organization to justify our substantial upfront investment. As a result, we
anticipate increased sales to large organizations will lead to higher upfront
sales costs and greater unpredictability in our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_We generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any
decline in demand for our platform or for communications and collaboration
technologies in general would harm our business._**

We generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sale of
subscriptions to our platform. As a result, widespread acceptance and use of
communications and collaboration technologies in general, and our platform in
particular, is critical to our future growth and success. If the
communications and collaboration technologies market fails to grow or grows
more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our platform could be
negatively affected.

Changes in user preferences for communications and collaboration technologies
may have a disproportionately greater impact on us than if we offered multiple
platforms or disparate products. Demand for communications and collaboration
technologies in general, and our platform in particular, is affected by a
number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Some of these
potential factors include:



  |  |   |

awareness of the communications and collaboration technologies category
generally;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

availability of products and services that compete with ours;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

new modes of communications and collaboration that may be developed in the
future;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

ease of adoption and use;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

features and platform experience;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

reliability of our platform, including frequency of outages;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

performance;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

brand;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

security and privacy;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

user support; and  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

pricing.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
The communications and collaboration technologies market is subject to rapidly
changing user demand and trends in preferences. If we fail to successfully
predict and address these changes and trends, meet user demands or achieve
more widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business would be
harmed.

**_The experience of our users depends upon the interoperability of our
platform across devices, operating systems and third-party applications that
we do not control, and if we are not able to maintain and expand our
relationships with third parties to integrate our platform with their
solutions, our business may be harmed._**

One of the most important features of our platform is its broad
interoperability with a range of diverse devices, operating systems and third-
party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices
running Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android and Linux. We also have integrations
with Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Salesforce, Slack and a
variety of other productivity, collaboration, data management and security
vendors. We are dependent on the accessibility of our platform across these
and other third-party operating systems and applications that we do not
control. For example, given the broad adoption of Microsoft Office and other
productivity software, it is important that we are able to integrate with this
software. Several of our competitors own, develop, operate, or distribute
operating systems, app stores, co-located data center services and other
software, and also have material business relationships with companies that
own, develop, operate or distribute operating systems, applications markets,
co-located data center services and other software that our platform requires
in order to operate. Moreover, some of these competitors have inherent
advantages developing products and services that more tightly integrate with
their software and hardware platforms or those of their business partners.



17

##### Table of Contents

Third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be
able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other
third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our
competitors may be able to disrupt the operations or compatibility of our
platform with their products or services, or exert strong business influence
on our ability to, and terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.
For example, we currently offer products that directly compete with several
large technology companies that we rely on to ensure the interoperability of
our platform with their products or services. As our respective products
evolve, we expect this level of competition to increase. Should any of our
competitors modify their products or standards in a manner that degrades the
functionality of our platform or gives preferential treatment to competitive
products or services, whether to enhance their competitive position or for any
other reason, the interoperability of our platform with these products could
decrease and our business could be harmed.

In addition, we provide, develop and create applications for our platform
partners that integrate our platform with our partners various offerings. For
example, our Zoom Meetings product integrates with tools offered by companies
such as Atlassian and Dropbox to help teams get more done together. If we are
not able to continue and expand on existing and new relationships to integrate
our platform with our partners solutions, or there are quality issues with
our products or service interruptions of our products that integrate with our
partners solutions, our business will be harmed.

**_We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our
platform or develop new features._**

The communications and collaboration technologies market is characterized by
rapid technological change and frequent new product and service introductions.
Our ability to grow our user base and increase revenue from customers will
depend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform, introduce
new features and products and interoperate across an increasing range of
devices, operating systems and third-party applications. Our customers may
require features and capabilities that our current platform does not have. We
invest significantly in research and development, and our goal is to focus our
spending on measures that improve quality and ease of adoption and create
organic user demand for our platform. There is no assurance that our
enhancements to our platform or our new product experiences, features or
capabilities will be compelling to our users or gain market acceptance. If our
research and development investments do not accurately anticipate user demand,
or if we fail to develop our platform in a manner that satisfies user
preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our
existing users or increase demand for our platform.

The introduction of new products and services by competitors or the
development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could
make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition. We may experience difficulties with
software development, design or marketing that could delay or prevent our
development, introduction, or implementation of new product experiences,
features, or capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our
internally planned release dates of new features and capabilities, and there
can be no assurance that new product experiences, features or capabilities
will be released according to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse
publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or claims by users brought
against us, all of which could harm our business. Moreover, new productivity
features to our platform may require substantial investment, and we have no
assurance that such investments will be successful. If customers and hosts do
not widely adopt our new product experiences, features and capabilities, we
may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we are unable to
develop, license or acquire new features and capabilities to our platform on a
timely and cost-effective basis, or if such enhancements do not achieve market
acceptance, our business would be harmed.

**_The failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales
capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve
broader market acceptance of our platform._**

Our ability to increase our customer and host base and achieve broader market
acceptance of our products and services will depend to a significant extent on
our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan to continue
expanding our sales force and strategic partners, both domestically and
internationally.

Identifying and recruiting qualified sales representatives and training them
is time-consuming and resource-intensive, and they may not be fully trained
and productive for a significant amount of time. We also plan to dedicate
significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including internet and
other online advertising. Further, we are currently recruiting a new Head of
Worldwide Sales or role with similar responsibility, which will require
significant management time and resources. All of these efforts will require
us to invest significant financial and other resources. In addition, the cost
to acquire customers and hosts is high due to these marketing and sales
efforts. Our business will be harmed if our efforts do not generate a
correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We will not achieve
anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to
hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, if our new sales personnel
are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of
time or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective.

**_Our security measures have on occasion, in the past, been, and may in the
future be, compromised. Consequently, our products and services may be
perceived as not being secure. This perception may result in customers and
hosts curtailing or ceasing their use of our products, our incurring
significant liabilities and our business being harmed._**

Our operations involve the storage and transmission of customer data or
information, and security incidents have occurred in the past, and may occur
in the future, resulting in unauthorized access to, loss of or unauthorized
disclosure of this information, regulatory enforcement actions, litigation,
indemnity obligations and other possible liabilities, as well as negative
publicity, which could damage our reputation, impair our sales and harm our
business. Cyberattacks and other malicious internet-based activity continue to
increase, and cloud-based platform providers of products and services have
been and are expected to continue to be targeted. In addition to traditional
computer hackers, malicious code (such as viruses and worms), employee theft
or misuse and denial-of-service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and
nation-state supported actors now engage in attacks (including advanced
persistent threat intrusions). Despite significant efforts to create security
barriers to such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely
mitigate these risks. If our security measures are compromised as a result of
third-party action, employee, customer, host or user error, malfeasance,
stolen or fraudulently-obtained log-in credentials or otherwise, our
reputation would be damaged, our data, information or intellectual property,
or those of our customers, may be destroyed, stolen or otherwise compromised,
our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liability. We have
not always been able in the past and may be unable in the future to anticipate
or prevent techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to compromise our
systems because they change frequently and are generally not detected until
after an incident has occurred. For example, in July 2018 we were made aware
of a vulnerability in the Zoom Meeting client for Windows that could result in
potential exposure of a Zoom users password. Additionally, in 2018, a
cybersecurity company discovered a vulnerability in our software that could be
exploited by hackers to exert certain meeting controls. While we were able to
deploy updates to the software addressing these vulnerabilities and we are not
aware of any customers being affected or meetings compromised by these
vulnerabilities, customers are responsible for installing this update to the
software and their software is subject to these vulnerabilities until they do
so. Additionally, we cannot be certain that we will be able to address any
vulnerabilities in our software that we may become aware of in the future. We
expect similar issues to arise in the future as we continue to expand the
features and functionality of existing products and introduce new products,
and we expect to expend significant resources in an effort to protect against
security incidents. Concerns regarding privacy, data protection and
information security may cause some of our customers and hosts to stop using
our solutions and fail to renew their subscriptions. This discontinuance in
use or failure to renew could substantially harm our business. Further, as we
rely on third-party and public-cloud infrastructure, we depend in part on
third-party security measures to protect against unauthorized access,
cyberattacks and the mishandling of data and information. In addition,
failures to meet customers and hosts expectations with respect to security
and confidentiality of their data and information could damage our reputation
and affect our ability to retain customers and hosts, attract new customers
and hosts and grow our business. In addition, a cybersecurity event could
result in significant increases in costs, including costs for remediating the
effects of such an event, lost revenue due to network downtime, and a decrease
in customer, host and user trust, increases in insurance

premiums due to cybersecurity incidents, increased costs to address
cybersecurity issues and attempts to prevent future incidents, and harm to our
business and our reputation because of any such incident.

Many governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of
data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. In addition,
some of our customers require us to notify them of data security breaches.
Security compromises experienced by our competitors, by our customers or by us
may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to widespread negative
publicity. In addition, we have a high concentration of research and
development personnel in China, which could expose us to market scrutiny
regarding the integrity of our solution or data security features. Any
security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm
our reputation, erode confidence in the effectiveness of our security
measures, negatively affect our ability to attract new customers and hosts,
cause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions or subject
us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability,
which could harm our business.

There can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our
subscription agreements would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise
protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular
claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance
coverage and coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue
to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts
to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not deny coverage
as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims
against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of
changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the
imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, would harm our
business.

**_Our business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain
and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our base of users will be
impaired and our business will be harmed._**

We believe that our brand identity and awareness have contributed to our
success and have helped fuel our efficient go-to-market strategy. We connect
people through frictionless video, voice, chat and content sharing. We also
believe that maintaining and enhancing the Zoom brand is critical to expanding
our base of customers, hosts and users and, in particular, conveying to users
and the public that the Zoom brand consists of a broad communications
platform, rather than just one distinct product. For example, if users
incorrectly view the Zoom brand primarily as a video conferencing point
solution or utility rather than as a platform with multiple communications
solutions, then our market position may be detrimentally impacted at such time
as a competitor introduces a new or better product. We anticipate that, as our
market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand
may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or
perception of our platform or the providers of communication and collaboration
technologies generally could adversely affect our reputation and our ability
to attract and retain hosts. If we fail to promote and maintain the Zoom
brand, including consumer and public perception of our platform, or if we
incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business will be harmed.

**_We have a history of net losses, and we expect to increase our expenses in
the future, which could prevent us from achieving or maintaining
profitability._**

Although we generated net income of $7.6 million for the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2019, we have incurred net losses in the past, including a net
loss of $3.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018, and could
incur net losses in the future. We intend to continue to expend significant
funds to expand our direct sales force and marketing efforts to attract new
customers and hosts, to develop and enhance our products and for general
corporate purposes, including operations, hiring additional personnel,
upgrading our infrastructure and expanding into new geographical markets. To
the extent we are successful in increasing our user base, we may also incur
increased losses because, other than sales commissions, the costs associated
with acquiring customers and hosts are generally incurred up front, while the
subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the subscription
term, which can be monthly, annual or on a multi-year basis. Our efforts to
grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to
increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating

expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of
reasons, including as a result of the other risks described herein, and
unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown
events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the value of
our business and Class A common stock may significantly decrease. Furthermore,
it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market, customer
demand for our platform, user adoption and renewal of our platform, the entry
of competitive products and services, or the success of existing competitive
products and services. As a result, we may not achieve or maintain
profitability in future periods. If we fail to grow our revenue sufficiently
to keep pace with our investments and other expenses, our business would be
harmed.

**_We may not successfully manage our growth or plan for future growth._**

Since our founding in 2011, we have experienced rapid growth. For example, our
headcount has grown to 1,702 full-time employees as of January 31, 2019, with
employees located both in the United States and internationally. The growth
and expansion of our business places a continuous, significant strain on our
management, operational and financial resources. Further growth of our
operations to support our user base, our expanding third-party relationships,
our information technology systems and our internal controls and procedures
may not be adequate to support our operations. In addition, as we continue to
grow, we face challenges of integrating, developing and motivating a rapidly
growing employee base in various countries around the world. Certain members
of our management have not previously worked together for an extended period
of time, and some do not have experience managing a public company, which may
affect how they manage our growth. Managing our growth will also require
significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources.

In addition, our rapid growth may make it difficult to evaluate our future
prospects. Our ability to forecast our future results of operations is subject
to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for
and model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in
the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing
companies in rapidly changing industries. If we fail to achieve the necessary
level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are not able to
accurately forecast future growth, our business would be harmed.

**_Our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform could be harmed by real
or perceived material defects or errors in our platform._**

The software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may
contain material defects or errors, particularly when new products are first
introduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from
time to time found defects or errors in our platform, and new defects or
errors in our existing platform or new products may be detected in the future
by us or our users. There can be no assurance that our existing platform and
new products will not contain defects. Any real or perceived errors, failures,
vulnerabilities, or bugs in our platform could result in negative publicity or
lead to data security, access, retention or other performance issues, all of
which could harm our business. The costs incurred in correcting such defects
or errors may be substantial and could harm our business. Moreover, the harm
to our reputation and legal liability related to such defects or errors may be
substantial and would harm our business.

We also utilize hardware purchased or leased and software and services
licensed from third parties to offer our platform. Any defects in, or
unavailability of, our or third-party hardware, software or services that
cause interruptions to the availability of our services, loss of data or
performance issues could, among other things:



  |  |   |

cause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our platform;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

require us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for
damages;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

cause us to lose existing hosts and make it more difficult to attract new
customers and hosts;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

divert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to
our platform, which would increase our expenses;

**_If we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other
members of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute our
business strategy._**

Our success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members
of our senior management team. In particular, our founder, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Eric S. Yuan, is critical to our overall management, as
well as the continued development of our products, services, the Zoom
platform, our culture, our strategic direction, engineering and our operations
in China. All of our executive officers are at **-** will employees, and we do
not maintain any key **** person life insurance policies. The loss of any
member of our senior management team would harm our business.

**_The failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel or to
maintain our happiness-centric company culture could harm our business and
culture and prevent us from executing our business strategy._**

To execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified
personnel. Competition for executives, software developers, sales personnel
and other key employees in our industry is intense. In particular, we compete
with many other companies for software developers with high levels of
experience in designing, developing and managing software for communication
and collaboration technologies, as well as for skilled sales and operations
professionals. At times, we have experienced, and we may continue to
experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate
qualifications, and we may not be able to fill positions. For example, our
former Head of Worldwide Sales recently transitioned from this position and as
one of our executive officers to a corporate strategy role with us, and while
he will continue to be a key contributor, we will need to spend significant
resources on recruiting a new Head of Worldwide Sales or role with similar
responsibility. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and
motivate our current personnel, our business could be harmed.

Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have
greater resources than we have, and some of these companies may offer greater
compensation packages. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, job
candidates and existing employees carefully consider the value of the equity
awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived
value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash
compensation that we offer is unattractive, it may adversely affect our
ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. Job candidates may
also be threatened with legal action under agreements with their existing
employers if we attempt to hire them, which could impact hiring and result in
a diversion of our time and resources. Additionally, laws and regulations,
such as restrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to recruit
internationally. We must also continue to retain and motivate existing
employees through our compensation practices, company culture and career
development opportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain
our current personnel, our business would be harmed.

We believe that a critical component to our success and our ability to retain
our best people is our culture. As we continue to grow and develop a public
company infrastructure, we may find it difficult to maintain our happiness-
centric company culture. Transparency is also an important part of our
culture, and one that we practice every day. As we continue to grow,
maintaining this culture of transparency will present its own challenges that
we will need to address, including the type of information and level of detail
that we share with our employees. For example, we were recently informed of a
personal relationship involving our Chief Financial Officer and an individual
with whom she worked, while they were both at her prior employer. After
reviewing the facts and circumstances of the situation, we confirmed that our
Chief Financial Officer can and should continue to serve in her role. However,
these are the types of situations that will continue to challenge our culture
of transparency, especially as we become a public company and operate under
the rules and responsibilities to which public companies are subject.

In addition, many of our employees may be able to receive significant proceeds
from sales of our equity in the public markets after our initial public
offering, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us.
Moreover, this offering could create disparities in wealth among our
employees, which may harm our culture and relations among employees and our
business.

**_We are continuing to expand our operations outside the United States, where
we may be subject to increased business and economic risks that could harm our
business._**

We have customers in over 180 countries, and 18% of our revenue in the fiscal
year ended January 31, 2019 was generated from customers in APAC and EMEA. In
fiscal 2018, we established a physical sales presence in Australia and the
United Kingdom. Additionally, as of January 31, 2019, we had five additional
international sales locations, and we plan to add local sales support in
further select international markets over time. We also operate research and
development centers in China, employing over 500 employees as of January 31,
2019. We expect to continue to expand our international operations, which may
include opening offices in new jurisdictions and providing our platform in
additional languages. Any new markets or countries into which we attempt to
sell subscriptions to our platform may not be receptive. For example, we may
not be able to expand further in some markets if we are not able to satisfy
certain government- and industry-specific requirements. In addition, our
ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally in
the future may require considerable management attention and resources and is
subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business
in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and
regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems and commercial markets. Future
international expansion will require investment of significant funds and other
resources. Operating internationally subjects us to new risks and may increase
risks that we currently face, including risks associated with:



  |  |   |

recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees outside the United
States and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

providing our platform and operating our business across a significant
distance, in different languages and among different cultures, including the
potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they are
culturally appropriate and relevant in different countries;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

compliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws
and regulations with respect to privacy, telecommunications requirements, data
protection, consumer protection and unsolicited email, and the risk of
penalties to us and individual members of management or employees if our
practices are deemed to be out of compliance;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

management of an employee base in jurisdictions that may not give us the same
employment and retention flexibility as does the United States;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

operating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to
the same extent as does the United States and the practical enforcement of
such intellectual property rights outside of the United States;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

foreign government interference with our non-core intellectual property that
resides outside of the United States, such as the risk of changes in foreign
laws that could restrict our ability to use our intellectual property outside
of the foreign jurisdiction in which we developed it;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

integration with partners outside of the United States;

international markets;  
  
---|---|---|---

up operations in certain geographic territories and might prevent us from
repatriating cash earned outside the United States;

  |  |   |

higher costs of doing business internationally, including increased
accounting, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
Compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations
substantially increases our cost of doing business in international
jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and
regulations as they occur. Although we have implemented policies and
procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and regulations,
there can be no assurance that we will always maintain compliance or that all
of our employees, contractors, partners and agents will comply. Any violations
could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and criminal penalties,
damages, injunctions or reputational harm. If we are unable to comply with
these laws and regulations or manage the complexity of our global operations
successfully, we may need to relocate or cease operations in certain foreign
jurisdictions. For example, our product development team is largely based in
China, where personnel costs are less expensive than in many other
jurisdictions. If we had to relocate our product development team from China
to another jurisdiction, we could experience, among other things, higher
operating expenses, which would adversely impact our operating margins and
harm our business. In addition, we would need to spend considerable time and
effort recruiting a new product development team, which would distract
management and adversely impact our ability to continue improving our
platforms features and functionality.

**_Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect
the underlying performance of our business._**

Our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future, and
period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be
meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied
upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly results of
operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which
are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the
underlying performance of our business. Fluctuation in quarterly results may
negatively impact the value of our securities. Factors that may cause
fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations include, without
limitation, those listed below:

Meeting plans;

**_We recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of
these subscriptions. Consequently, increases or decreases in new sales may not
be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be difficult to
discern._**

We recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of
these subscriptions. As a result, a portion of the revenue we report in each
quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to
subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline
in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter may have a small impact
on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a decline
will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect
of significant downturns in sales and potential changes in our pricing
policies or rate of customer expansion or retention may not be fully reflected
in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant
portion of our costs are expensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized
over the term of the subscription. As a result, growth in the number of new
customers and hosts could continue to result in our recognition of higher
costs and lower revenue in the earlier periods of our subscriptions. Finally,
our subscription-based revenue model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly
increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from
new customers or from existing customers that increase their use of our
platform or upgrade to a higher-priced tier of Zoom Meeting plan must be
recognized over the applicable subscription term.

**_Any failure to offer high-quality support for our customers and hosts may
harm our relationships with our customers and hosts and, consequently, our
business._**

We have designed our platform to be easy to adopt and use with minimal to no
support necessary. However, if we experience increased user demand for
support, we may face increased costs that may harm our results of operations.
In addition, as we continue to grow our operations and support our global user
base, we need to be able to continue to provide efficient support that meets
our customers and hosts needs globally at scale. Customers and hosts receive
additional support features, and the number of our hosts has grown
significantly, which will put additional pressure on our support organization.
If we are unable to provide efficient user support globally at scale or if we
need to hire additional support personnel, our business may be harmed. Our new
customer and host signups are highly dependent on our business reputation and
on positive recommendations from our existing customers and hosts. Any failure
to maintain high-quality support, or a market perception that we do not
maintain high-quality support for our customers and hosts, would harm our
business.

**_Our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy, data protection and
information security laws, regulations, and obligations could harm our
business._**

We receive, store, process and use personal information and other user
content. There are numerous federal, state, local and international laws and
regulations regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the



25

* * *

##### Table of Contents

storing, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure and protection of
personal information and other content, the scope of which is changing,
subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among countries,
or conflict with other rules. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy
policies and obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection
and information security. We strive to comply with applicable laws,
regulations, policies and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data
protection and information security to the extent possible. However, the
regulatory framework for privacy and data protection worldwide is, and is
likely to remain, uncertain for the foreseeable future, and it is possible
that these or other actual or alleged obligations may be interpreted and
applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and
may conflict with other rules or our practices.

We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations and
industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information
security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, in May
2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in the
European Union (EU). The GDPR imposed more stringent data protection
requirements and provides greater penalties for noncompliance than previous
data protection laws, including potential penalties of up to 20 million or 4%
of annual global revenues. Further, following a referendum in June 2016 in
which voters in the United Kingdom approved an exit from the EU, the United
Kingdom government has initiated a process to leave the EU, known as Brexit.
Brexit has created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data
protection in the United Kingdom. In particular, although the United Kingdom
enacted a Data Protection Act in May 2018 that is designed to be consistent
with the GDPR, uncertainty remains regarding how data transfers to and from
the United Kingdom will be regulated. Additionally, although we have self-
certified under the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Privacy Shield Frameworks with
regard to our transfer of certain personal data from the EU and Switzerland to
the United States, some regulatory uncertainty remains surrounding the future
of data transfers from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, and we are
monitoring regulatory developments in this area. California also recently
enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), that
will afford consumers expanded privacy protections when it goes into effect on
January 1, 2020. The CCPA was recently amended, and it is possible that it
will be amended again before it goes into effect. The potential effects of
this legislation are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data
processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses
in an effort to comply. For example, the CCPA gives California residents
expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information,
opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed
information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also
provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of
action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation.

With laws and regulations such as the GDPR in the EU and the CCPA in the
United States imposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with
substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and
other laws and regulations, we may face challenges in addressing their
requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and
may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so. Any failure or
perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-,
data protection- or information security-related obligations to users or other
third parties or any of our other legal obligations relating to privacy, data
protection or information security may result in governmental investigations
or enforcement actions, litigation, claims or public statements against us by
consumer advocacy groups or others, and could result in significant liability
or cause our users to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on
our reputation and business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and
other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations and policies that are
applicable to the businesses of our users may limit the adoption and use of,
and reduce the overall demand for, our platform.

Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors or developers,
violate applicable laws or regulations or our policies, such violations may
also put our users content at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect
on our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or
industry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security or
disclosure of our users content, or regarding the manner in which the express
or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention or disclosure
of such content is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify
our services and features, possibly in a material

manner, which we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability to store
and process user data or develop new services and features.

**_Our results of operations may be harmed if we are required to collect sales
or other related taxes for our subscription services in jurisdictions where we
have not historically done so._**

We collect sales tax in a number of jurisdictions. One or more states or
countries may seek to impose incremental or new sales, use, or other tax
collection obligations on us. A successful assertion by a state, country or
other jurisdiction that we should have been or should be collecting additional
sales, use, or other taxes could, among other things, result in substantial
tax payments, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage
potential customers from subscribing to our platform due to the incremental
cost of any such sales or other related taxes, or otherwise harm our business.

**_We may be subject to liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges and
fees._**

We currently collect and remit applicable sales tax in jurisdictions where we,
through our employees, have a presence and where we have determined, based on
legal precedents in the jurisdiction, that sales of our platform are
classified as taxable. We do not currently collect and remit other state and
local excise, utility user and ad valorem taxes, fees or surcharges that may
apply to our customers and hosts. We believe that we are not otherwise subject
to, or required to collect, any additional taxes, fees or surcharges imposed
by state and local jurisdictions because we do not have a sufficient physical
presence or nexus in the relevant taxing jurisdiction or such taxes, fees,
or surcharges do not apply to sales of our platform in the relevant taxing
jurisdiction. However, there is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient
physical presence or nexus for a state or local jurisdiction to levy taxes,
fees and surcharges for sales made over the internet, and there is also
uncertainty as to whether our characterization of our platform as not taxable
in certain jurisdictions will be accepted by state and local taxing
authorities. Additionally, we have not historically collected value-added tax
(VAT) or goods and services tax (GST) on sales of our platform because we make
all of our sales through our office in the United States, and we believe,
based on information provided to us by our customers, that most of our sales
are made to business customers.

Taxing authorities may challenge our position that we do not have sufficient
nexus in a taxing jurisdiction or that our platform is not taxable in the
jurisdiction and may decide to audit our business and operations with respect
to sales, use, telecommunications, VAT, GST and other taxes, which could
result in increased tax liabilities for us or our customers and hosts, which
could harm our business.

The application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, VAT, GST,
business tax and gross receipt tax) to businesses that transact online, such
as ours, is a complex and evolving area. Following the recent U.S. Supreme
Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., states are now free to levy
taxes on sales of goods and services based on an economic nexus, regardless
of whether the seller has a physical presence in the state. As a result, it
may be necessary to reevaluate whether our activities give rise to sales, use
and other indirect taxes as a result of any nexus in those states in which we
are not currently registered to collect and remit taxes. Additionally, we may
need to assess our potential tax collection and remittance liabilities based
on existing economic nexus laws dollar and transaction thresholds. We
continue to analyze our exposure for such taxes and liabilities and have
accrued $8.9 million and $22.0 million for the fiscal years ended January 31,
2018 and 2019, respectively, for loss contingencies resulting from these
potential taxes and liabilities. The application of existing, new, or future
laws, whether in the U.S. or internationally, could harm our business. There
have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with
complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets
in which we conduct or will conduct business.

**_We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair
our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements
and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable
laws._**

Our platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under
U.S. export control and sanctions laws and regulations, including the U.S.
Department of Commerces Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and various
economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department
of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The U.S. export
control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions or
prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S.
embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities, and also
require authorization for the export of certain encryption items. In addition,
various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology,
including through import permitting and licensing requirements and have
enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to distribute our
platform or could limit our hosts ability to implement our platform in those
countries.

Although we take precautions to prevent our platform and associated products
from being accessed or used in violation of such laws, we have inadvertently
allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used by some
customers in apparent violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition,
we may have inadvertently made our software products available to some
customers, including users in embargoed or sanctioned countries, in apparent
violation of the EAR. As a result, we have submitted initial and final
voluntary self-disclosures concerning potential violations of U.S. sanctions
and export control laws and regulations to OFAC and the U.S. Department of
Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security. If we are found to be in violation
of U.S. economic sanctions or export control laws, it could result in fines
and penalties. We may also be adversely affected through other penalties,
reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets or otherwise. While we
are working to implement additional controls designed to prevent similar
activity from occurring in the future, these controls may not be fully
effective.

Changes in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions and import laws, may
delay the introduction and sale of subscriptions to our platform in
international markets, prevent our customers with international operations
from using our platform or, in some cases, prevent the access or use of our
platform to and from certain countries, governments, persons or entities
altogether. Further, any change in export or import regulations, economic
sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing
regulations or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies
targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our platform or
in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to existing or
potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our
platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would
likely harm our business.

**_We utilize our network of resellers to sell our products and services, and
our failure to effectively develop, manage and maintain our indirect sales
channels would harm our business._**

Our future success depends on our continued ability to establish and maintain
a network of channel relationships, and we expect that we will need to
maintain and expand our network as we expand into international markets. A
small portion of our revenue is derived from our network of sales agents and
resellers, which we refer to collectively as resellers, many of which sell or
may in the future decide to sell their own products and services or services
from other communications solutions providers. Loss of or reduction in sales
through these third parties could reduce our revenue. Our competitors may in
some cases be effective in causing our reseller or potential reseller to favor
their products and services or prevent or reduce sales of our products and
services. Recruiting and retaining qualified resellers in our network and
training them in our technology and product offerings requires significant
time and resources. If we decide to further develop and expand our indirect
sales channels, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and
procedures to support these channels, including investment in systems and
training. Many resellers may not be willing to invest the time and resources
required to train their staff to effectively sell our platform. If we fail to
maintain relationships with our resellers,



28

* * *

##### Table of Contents

fail to develop relationships with new resellers in new markets or expand the
number of resellers in existing markets or fail to manage, train, or provide
appropriate incentives to our existing resellers, our ability to increase the
number of new customers and hosts and increase sales to existing customers
could be adversely impacted, which would harm our business.

**_Our results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be
adversely affected if currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the
future._**

We sell to customers globally and have international operations primarily in
Australia, China and the United Kingdom. As we continue to expand our
international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of
fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although the majority of our cash
generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a small amount is
denominated in foreign currencies, and our expenses are generally denominated
in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. For
the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, 6.4% of our revenue and 12.3% of our
expenses were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Because we
conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our results
of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to
predict our future results and earnings and could materially impact our
results of operations. We do not currently maintain a program to hedge
exposures to non-U.S. dollar currencies.

**_Our current products, as well as products, features and functionality that
we may introduce in the future, may not be widely accepted by our customers
and hosts or may receive negative attention or may require us to compensate or
reimburse third parties, any of which may lower our margins and harm our
business._**

Our ability to engage, retain and increase our base of customers and hosts and
to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to successfully create new
products, features and functionality, both independently and together with
third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products
or develop and introduce new and unproven products, including technologies
with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience.
These new products and updates may fail to engage, retain and increase our
base of customers and hosts or may create lag in adoption of such new
products. New products may initially suffer from performance and quality
issues that may negatively impact our ability to market and sell such products
to new and existing customers and hosts. The short- and long-term impact of
any major change to our products, or the introduction of new products, is
particularly difficult to predict. If new or enhanced products fail to engage,
retain and increase our base of customers and hosts, we may fail to generate
sufficient revenue, operating margin or other value to justify our investments
in such products, any of which may harm our business in the short term, long
term, or both.

In addition, our current products, as well as products, features and
functionality that we may introduce in the future, may require us to
compensate or reimburse third parties. For example, our new cloud phone
system, Zoom Phone, is a private branch exchange phone solution that requires
us to compensate carriers that operate the public switched telephone network.
As a result, a portion of the payments that we will receive from customers
that will use our Zoom Phone product will be allocated towards compensating
these telephone carriers, which lowers our margins for Zoom Phone as compared
to our other products. In addition, new products that we introduce in the
future may similarly require us to compensate or reimburse third parties, all
of which would lower our profit margins for any such new products. If this
trend continues with our new and existing products, including Zoom Phone, it
could harm our business.

**_The estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth included
in this prospectus may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which
we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at
similar rates, if at all._**

Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts included in this prospectus,
including those we have generated ourselves, are subject to significant
uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may



29

* * *

##### Table of Contents

not prove to be accurate. Not every organization covered by our market
opportunity estimates will necessarily buy video communications platforms at
all, and some or many of those organizations may choose to continue using
legacy communication methods or point solutions offered by our competitors. It
is impossible to build every product feature that every customer or host
wants, and our competitors may develop and offer features that our platform
does not provide. The variables that go into the calculation of our market
opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that
any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market
opportunity estimates will purchase our solutions at all or generate any
particular level of revenue for us. Even if the market in which we compete
meets the size estimates and growth forecasts in this prospectus, our business
could fail to grow for a variety of reasons outside of our control, including
competition in our industry. If any of these risks materialize, it could harm
our business and prospects. For more information regarding the estimates of
market opportunity and the forecasts of market growth included in this
prospectus, see the section titled Market and Industry Data.

**_We may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, a
variety of U.S. and international laws that could result in claims, increase
the cost of operations or otherwise harm our business due to changes in the
laws, changes in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the
laws or investigations into compliance with the laws._**

We may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, various
laws, including those covering copyright, indecent content, child protection,
consumer protection, telecommunications services, taxation and similar
matters. There have been instances where improper or illegal content has been
shared on our platform without our knowledge. As a service provider, we do not
regularly monitor our platform to evaluate the legality of content shared on
it. While to date we have not been subject to material legal or administrative
actions as a result of this content, the laws in this area are currently in a
state of flux and vary widely between jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be
possible that in the future we and our competitors may be subject to legal
actions, along with the users who shared such content. In addition, regardless
of any legal liability we may face, our reputation could be harmed should
there be an incident generating extensive negative publicity about the content
shared on our platform. Such publicity would harm our business.

We are also subject to consumer protection laws that may impact our sales and
marketing efforts, including laws related to subscriptions, billing and auto-
renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could adversely
affect our self-serve model and make it more difficult for us to retain and
upgrade customers and attract new customers and hosts. Additionally, we have
in the past, are currently and may from time to time in the future become the
subject of inquiries and other actions by regulatory authorities as a result
of our business practices, including our subscription, billing and auto-
renewal policies. Consumer protection laws may be interpreted or applied by
regulatory authorities in a manner that could require us to make changes to
our operations or incur fines, penalties or settlement expenses, which may
result in harm to our business.

Our platform depends on the ability of our customers, hosts and users to
access the internet, and our platform has been blocked or restricted in some
countries for various reasons. If we fail to anticipate developments in the
law, or fail for any reason to comply with relevant law, our platform could be
further blocked or restricted, and we could be exposed to significant
liability that could harm our business.

We are also subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws,
such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, as
well as other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations.
These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their employees
and intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing improper payments
or benefits to officials and other recipients for improper purposes. Although
we take precautions to prevent violations of these laws, our exposure for
violating these laws increases as we continue to expand our international
presence, and any failure to comply with such laws could harm our business.

**_Zoom Phone is subject to U.S. federal and international regulation, and
other products we may introduce in the future may also be subject to U.S.
federal, state or international laws, rules and regulations. Any failure to
comply with such laws, rules and regulations could harm our business and
expose us to liability._**

_Federal Regulation_

Our recently introduced product, Zoom Phone, is provided through our wholly
owned subsidiary, Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which is regulated by the
FCC as an interconnected voice over internet protocol (VoIP) service provider.
As a result, Zoom Phone is subject to existing or potential FCC regulations,
including but not limited to regulations relating to privacy, disability
access, porting of numbers, federal Universal Service Fund (USF),
contributions and other regulatory assessments, emergency calling/Enhanced 911
(E-911) and law enforcement access. Congress or the FCC may expand the scope
of Zoom Phones regulatory obligations at any time. In addition, FCC
classification of Zoom Phone as a common carrier or telecommunications service
could result in additional federal and state regulatory obligations. If we do
not comply with any current or future state regulations that apply to our
business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may have
to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets or raise the price
of our products, any of which could ultimately harm our business and results
of operations. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public
process, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our
ability to sell Zoom Phone to our customers and harm our business.

_State Regulation_

State telecommunications regulation of Zoom Phone is generally preempted by
the FCC. However, states are allowed to assess state USF contributions, E-911
fees and other surcharges. A number of states require us to contribute to
state USF and pay E-911 and other assessments and surcharges, while others are
actively considering extending their programs to include the products we
offer. We generally pass USF, E-911 fees and other surcharges through to our
customers where we are permitted to do so, which may result in our products
becoming more expensive. We expect that state public utility commissions will
continue their attempts to apply state telecommunications regulations to
services like Zoom Phone. If we do not comply with any current or future state
regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial
fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit
certain markets or raise the price of our products, any of which could harm
our business.

_International Regulation_

As we expand internationally, we may be subject to telecommunications,
consumer protection, privacy, data protection and other laws and regulations
in the foreign countries where we offer our products. In the future, we intend
to offer Zoom Phone internationally. If we do not comply with any current or
future international regulations that apply to our business, we could be
subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our
product offerings, exit certain markets or raise the price of our products,
any of which could harm our business.

**_We are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property
rights claims and other litigation matters, which, if resolved adversely,
could harm our business._**

We protect our intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trademarks,
domain names and trade secrets and, from time to time, are subject to
litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other
violations of intellectual property or other rights. As we face increasing
competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of
intellectual property rights claims, commercial claims and other assertions
against us grows. We have in the past been, are currently, and may from time
to time in the future become, a party to litigation and disputes related to
our intellectual property, our business practices and our platform. For
example, on February 28, 2019, Wave Linx LLC (Wave Linx) filed a lawsuit
against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging
that we infringe a patent owned by Wave Linx. Also, on April 5, 2019, Krush
Technologies, Inc. (Krush) filed a lawsuit against us in the Northern District
Court of California, alleging that we infringe three patents that Krush
acquired. Krush is seeking a permanent injunction



31

* * *

##### Table of Contents

against infringement, treble damages and attorneys fees. While we intend to
defend these lawsuits vigorously and believe that we have valid defenses to
these claims, litigation can be costly and time-consuming, divert the
attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and
dissuade potential customers from subscribing to our services, which would
harm our business. Furthermore, with respect to these lawsuits, there can be
no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. We may need to settle
litigation and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us, or we may be
subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversible upon appeal. The
terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our
operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, our
agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions for
indemnifying them against liabilities if our services infringe a third partys
intellectual property rights, which could require us to make payments to our
customers. During the course of any litigation or dispute, we may make
announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions and other interim
developments. If securities analysts and investors regard these announcements
as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline. With
respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a
license to continue practices found to be in violation of third-party rights,
which may not be available on reasonable terms and may significantly increase
our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may not be
available to us at all, and we may be required to develop alternative non-
infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices. The
development of alternative, non-infringing technology or practices could
require significant effort and expense. Our business could be harmed as a
result.

**_Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary
information could diminish our brand and other intangible assets._**

We primarily rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent,
patent licenses, trade secret and domain name protection, trademark and
copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our
employees, consultants and third parties, to protect our intellectual property
and proprietary rights. In the United States and abroad, as of March 22, 2019,
we have two issued patents and seven pending patent applications. We make
business decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular
technology and when to rely upon copyright or trade secret protection, and the
approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where
we seek patent protection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents
will effectively protect every significant feature of our products. In
addition, we believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an
important factor in product recognition, protecting our brand and maintaining
goodwill. If we do not adequately protect our rights in our trademarks from
infringement and unauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in
those trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could harm our brand and our
business. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary
rights, third parties may challenge our proprietary rights, pending and future
patent, trademark and copyright applications may not be approved, and we may
not be able to prevent infringement without incurring substantial expense. We
have also devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary
technologies and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary
technologies and processes, we rely in part on trade secret laws and
confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties.
These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential
information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of
unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may
independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able
to assert trade secret rights, or develop similar technologies and processes.
Further, laws in certain jurisdictions may afford little or no trade secret
protection, and any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the
intellectual property laws in any country in which we operate may compromise
our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights. Costly and time-
consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of
our proprietary rights. If the protection of our proprietary rights is
inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our
platform, brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and competitors
may be able to more effectively replicate our platform and its features. Any
of these events would harm our business.

**_If we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving
credit card association merchant standards, we could incur substantial costs
and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our
customer and paid host base to decline significantly._**

A large portion of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card
accounts directly for our products. If customers pay for their subscriptions
with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs



32

* * *

##### Table of Contents

for which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with
credit card billing information online or over the phone, and we do not review
the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our risk
of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to
as chargebacks, from the credit card companies for claims that the customer
did not authorize the credit card transaction for our products, something that
we have experienced in the past. If the number of claims of unauthorized
credit card transactions becomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial
fines for excess chargebacks, and we could lose the right to accept credit
cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant
standards, including data protection and documentation standards, required to
utilize their services from time to time. If we fail to maintain compliance
with current merchant standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card
associations could fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would
be unable to accept credit cards as payment for our products. Our products may
also be subject to fraudulent usage and schemes, including third parties
accessing customer accounts or viewing and recording data from our
communications solutions. These fraudulent activities can result in
unauthorized access to customer accounts and data, unauthorized use of our
products, and charges and expenses to customers for fraudulent usage. We may
be required to pay for these charges and expenses with no reimbursement from
the customer, and our reputation may be harmed if our products are subject to
fraudulent usage. Although we implement multiple fraud prevention and
detection controls, we cannot assure you that these controls will be adequate
to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to
accept credit card payments would cause our customer base to significantly
decrease and would harm our business.

**_Our business may be significantly impacted by a change in the economy,
including any resulting effect on consumer or business spending._**

Our business may be affected by changes in the economy generally, including
any resulting effect on spending by our customers. While some of our customers
may consider our platform to be a cost-saving purchase, decreasing the need
for business travel, others may view a subscription to our platform as a
discretionary purchase, and our customers may reduce their discretionary
spending on our platform during an economic downturn. If an economic downturn
were to occur, we may experience such a reduction in demand and loss of
customers, especially in the event of a prolonged recessionary period.

**_Our business could be disrupted by catastrophic events._**

Occurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood,
tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure,
software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war or terrorist attack,
could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In particular, our U.S.
headquarters and some of the data centers we utilize are located in the San
Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity, and our insurance
coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an
earthquake or other significant natural disaster. In addition, acts of
terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole.
Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be
interrupted. If our systems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result
of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to deliver products to our
users would be impaired, or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to
develop adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to
operate during and after a disaster and to execute successfully on those plans
in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business would be harmed.

**_We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which
could harm our business._**

While to date we have not incurred significant income taxes in operating our
business, we are subject to income taxes in the United States and various
jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our effective tax rate could
fluctuate due to changes in the proportion of our earnings and losses in
countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be
impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits
of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of, or our ability to
use, deferred tax assets and liabilities, the applicability of withholding
taxes and effects from acquisitions.



33

* * *

##### Table of Contents

The provision for taxes on our financial statements could also be impacted by
changes in accounting principles, changes in U.S. federal, state or
international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the
recent legislation enacted in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United
States, other fundamental changes in law currently being considered by many
countries and changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations,
decisions, policies and positions.

We are subject to review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign
tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we take,
and if any such tax authority were to successfully challenge any such
position, our business could be harmed. We may also be subject to additional
tax liabilities due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from
changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing
jurisdictions administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and
positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions,
changes in accounting principles, changes to our business operations,
including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that
results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period.

**_Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other
tax attributes may be limited._**

As of January 31, 2019, we had $26.9 million of U.S. federal and $10.7 million
of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable
income, which will begin to expire in 2032 for federal and 2027 for state tax
purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to
use these net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration or at all.
Under legislative changes made in December 2017, U.S. federal net operating
losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward
indefinitely, but the deductibility of such net operating losses is limited.
It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly
enacted federal tax law. In addition, the federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards and certain tax credits may be subject to significant
limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code), respectively, and similar provisions of state
law. Under those sections of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an
ownership change, the corporations ability to use its pre-change net
operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research
tax credits, to offset its post-change income or tax may be limited. In
general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in
our ownership by 5-percent shareholders that exceeds 50 percentage points
over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax
laws. We have completed a Section 382 calculation and have determined that
none of the operating losses will expire solely due to Section 382
limitation(s). However, we may experience ownership changes as a result of
this offering or in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock
ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change
occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and tax
credits is materially limited, it would harm our business by effectively
increasing our future tax obligations.

**_Our reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States._**

Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to
interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various bodies formed to
promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these
principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported
results of operations and may even affect the reporting of transactions
completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. For example,
we recently adopted _Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers_ (ASC 606), effective as of February 1,
2017, utilizing the full retrospective method of adoption. The adoption of ASC
606 impacted the timing and manner in which we report our revenue and
expenses, especially with respect to our sales commissions. See Note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for
more information. It is also difficult to predict the impact of future changes
to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could harm
our business.

**_We may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional
financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all._**

Historically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily
through equity issuances and cash generated from our operations. Although we
currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flow
from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable
future, we may require additional financing. We evaluate financing
opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will
depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans,
operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek
financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to
us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds
through the issuance of equity or equity-linked or debt securities, those
securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of
our Class A common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.

**_Our use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our
ability to offer and sell subscriptions to our platform and subject us to
possible litigation._**

A portion of the technologies we use incorporates third-party open source
software, and we may incorporate third-party open source software in the
future. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other
third parties under open source licenses. From time to time, companies that
use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of
such open source software and requesting compliance with the open source
software license terms. Accordingly, we may be subject to suits by parties
claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming
non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open
source software licenses require end-users who use, distribute or make
available across a network software and services that include open source
software to offer aspects of the technology that incorporates the open source
software for no cost. We may also be required to make publicly available
source code (which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary
code) for modifications or derivative works we create based upon,
incorporating or using the open source software and/or to license such
modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open
source license. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has
incorporated open source software into software that we license from such
provider, we could be required to disclose any of our source code that
incorporates or is a modification of our licensed software. While we employ
practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party
open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may
inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us
to claims of non-compliance with the terms of their licenses, including claims
of intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract.
Furthermore, there exists today an increasing number of types of open source
software licenses, almost none of which have been tested in courts of law to
provide guidance of their proper legal interpretations. If we were to receive
a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of these open source licenses,
we may be required to publically release certain portions of our proprietary
source code. We could also be required to expend substantial time and
resources to re-engineer some of our software. Any of the foregoing could
disrupt and harm our business.

In addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us
to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open
source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the
functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also
present additional security risks because the public availability of such
software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine
how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could harm our business
and could help our competitors develop products and services that are similar
to or better than ours.

**_If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and
internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and
accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be
impaired._**

As a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and the rules



35

* * *

##### Table of Contents

and regulations of the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock
Market. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will
continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs,
make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and place
significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain
effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure
controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed
in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve
our internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and
improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate
that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-
related costs and significant management oversight.

Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. In addition,
changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our
internal controls and require that we establish new business processes,
systems and controls to accommodate such changes. For example, we will need to
implement new revenue recognition modules into our existing enterprise
resource planning system to facilitate the preparation of our financial
statements under ASC 606. We will also be required to adopt ASU 2016-02,
_Leases_ (Topic 842) _,_ which requires, among other things, lessees to
recognize most leases on-balance sheet via a right of use asset and lease
liability, beginning February 1, 2019. We have limited experience with
implementing the systems and controls that will be necessary to operate as a
public company, as well as adopting changes in accounting principles or
interpretations mandated by the relevant regulatory bodies. Additionally, if
these new systems, controls or standards and the associated process changes do
not give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it
could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and processes, our
ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports or the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be
harmed if we experience problems with any new systems and controls that result
in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-
implementation issues that may arise.

Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over
financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or
maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their
implementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to
meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our
financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely
affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent
registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will
eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed
with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence
in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a
negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition,
if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to
remain listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. We are not currently required to
comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that
purpose. As a public company, we will be required to provide an annual
management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10-K.

Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally
attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
until our first annual report filed with the SEC where we are an accelerated
filer or a large accelerated filer. At such time, our independent registered
public accounting firm may

##### Table of Contents

issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level
at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed
or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and
internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and could
cause a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock.

**_We may acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which
could require significant management attention, disrupt our business or dilute
stockholder value._**

We may in the future make acquisitions of other companies, products and
technologies. We have limited experience in acquisitions. We may not be able
to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete
acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we
may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals,
and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users,
developers or investors. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquired
businesses successfully or effectively manage the combined company following
an acquisition. If we fail to successfully integrate our acquisitions, or the
people or technologies associated with those acquisitions, into our company,
the results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected.
Any integration process will require significant time and resources, require
significant attention from management and disrupt the ordinary functioning of
our business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully, which
could harm our business. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate or
utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact
of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges.

We may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any
such acquisition, each of which could affect our financial condition or the
value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such
acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more
debt, it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us
to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to flexibly
operate our business.

**Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class  A Common Stock **

**_An active trading market for our Class  A common stock may never develop or
be sustained. _**

We have been approved to list our Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global
Select Market under the symbol ZM. However, we cannot assure you that an
active trading market for our Class A common stock will develop on that
exchange or elsewhere or, if developed, that any market will be sustained.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the likelihood that an active trading
market for our Class A common stock will develop or be maintained, your
ability to sell your shares of our Class A common stock when desired or the
prices that you may obtain for your shares.

**_The trading price of our Class  A common stock may be volatile, and you
could lose all or part of your investment. _**

Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for shares of our
Class A common stock. The initial public offering price of our Class A common
stock was determined through negotiation between us and the underwriters. This
price does not necessarily reflect the price at which investors in the market
will be willing to buy and sell shares of our Class A common stock following
this offering. In addition, the trading price of our Class A common stock
following this offering is likely to be volatile and could be subject to
fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our
control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your
investment in our Class A common stock as you might be unable to sell your
shares at or above the price you paid in this offering. Factors that could
cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include
the following:



  |  |   |

price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;

In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall
market and in the market price of a particular companys securities,
securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these
companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in
substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources.

**_The dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation has the effect of concentrating
voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to this
offering and the concurrent private placement, including our executive
officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, limiting your ability
to influence corporate matters._**

Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock,
which is the stock we are offering in this initial public offering and the
concurrent private placement, has one vote per share. The holders of our
outstanding Class B common stock will hold 99.0% of the voting power of our
outstanding capital stock following this offering and the concurrent private
placement, with our directors, executive officers and 5% stockholders and
their respective affiliates holding 61.6% of such voting power in the
aggregate. Our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric S. Yuan,
will hold approximately 18.2% of our outstanding capital stock but will
control approximately 19.9% of the voting power of our outstanding capital
stock following the completion of this offering and the concurrent private
placement. Therefore, these holders will have significant influence over our
management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval,
including



38

* * *

##### Table of Contents

election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger
or other sale of Zoom or our assets, for the foreseeable future. Each share of
Class B common stock will be automatically converted into one share of Class A
common stock upon the earliest of (i) the date that is six months following
the death or incapacity of Mr. Yuan, (ii) the date that is six months
following the date that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his
employment is terminated for cause, (iii) the date specified by the holders of
a majority of the then outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a
separate class, and (iv) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our initial
public offering.

In addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to
be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval even
if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the outstanding
shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability
to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result,
the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.

Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in
those shares converting to Class A common stock, which will have the effect,
over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B
common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr.
Yuan retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for
an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a majority of the
combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board
member, Mr. Yuan owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in
good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of
our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Yuan
is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be
in the interests of our stockholders generally.

In addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard & Poors announced that
they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-
class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected indices
include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600,
which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies,
our dual class capital structure would make us ineligible for inclusion in any
of these indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and
other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track these indices will
not be investing in our stock. These policies are new, and it is as of yet
unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly
traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may
depress these valuations or depress our trading volume compared to those of
other similar companies that are included.

**_If you purchase our Class  A common stock in this offering, you will incur
immediate and substantial dilution in the book value of your investment. _**

The initial public offering price of our Class A common stock is substantially
higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class A and
Class B common stock outstanding immediately following the completion of this
offering. Therefore, if you purchase shares of our Class A common stock in
this offering at the initial public offering price of $36.00 per share, you
will experience immediate dilution of $33.66 per share, the difference between
the price per share you pay for our Class A common stock and its pro forma net
tangible book value per share as of January 31, 2019, after giving effect to
the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock in this offering and the
concurrent private placement. This dilution is due in large part to the fact
that our earlier investors paid substantially less than the initial public
offering price when they purchased their shares of Class B common stock. In
addition, we have issued options to acquire our Class B common stock at prices
significantly below the initial public offering price. To the extent
outstanding options are ultimately exercised, there will be further dilution
to investors purchasing our Class A common stock in this offering. In
addition, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares or if we issue additional equity securities, you will experience
additional dilution.



39

##### Table of Contents

**_Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase
capital stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership
of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline._**

We may issue additional securities following the completion of this offering.
Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our
capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing
stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities and
other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner
as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in
subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in
such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges
senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock.

**_We will have broad discretion in the use of net proceeds from this offering
and the concurrent private placement and may invest or spend the proceeds in
ways with which you do not agree and in ways that may not yield a return._**

We cannot specify with any certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds
that we will receive from this offering and the concurrent private placement.
Our management will have broad discretion over the use of net proceeds from
this offering and the concurrent private placement, including for any of the
purposes described in Use of Proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity
as part of your investment decision to assess whether the net proceeds are
being used appropriately. Investors may not agree with our decisions, and our
use of the proceeds may not yield any return on your investment. Because of
the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net
proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement, their
ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. Our
failure to apply the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placement effectively could impair our ability to pursue our growth strategy
or could require us to raise additional capital.

**_Substantial future sales of shares of our Class  A common stock and Class B
common stock could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to
decline. _**

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class
B common stock (after automatically converting to Class A common stock) in the
public market following the completion of this offering, or the perception
that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A
common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of
additional equity securities. Many of our existing equityholders have
substantial unrecognized gains on the value of the equity they hold based upon
the price of this offering, and therefore they may take steps to sell their
shares or otherwise secure the unrecognized gains on those shares.

Based on shares outstanding as of January 31, 2019, upon the completion of
this offering, we will have outstanding a total of 24,070,086 shares of Class
A common stock and 232,318,285 shares of Class B common stock, assuming no
exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares and no
exercise of outstanding options, other than 283,177 shares to be issued upon
the exercise of options to purchase Class B common stock by certain selling
stockholders and sold in this offering, after giving effect to the conversion
of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into shares of Class B common
stock immediately upon the completion of this offering and after giving effect
to the conversion of 10,958,131 shares of Class B common stock into Class A
common stock upon the sale of such shares by the selling stockholders. Of
these shares, only the shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering
will be freely tradable, without restriction, in the public market immediately
after the offering and the concurrent private placement. All of our executive
officers and directors and the holders of substantially all the shares of our
capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital
stock have entered into market standoff agreements with us or have entered or
will enter into lock-up agreements with the underwriters that restrict their
ability to transfer shares of our capital stock during the period ending on,
and including, the 180th day after the date of this prospectus, subject to
specified exceptions. We refer to such period as the lock-up period. We and
the underwriters may permit certain stockholders who are subject to these
market standoff agreements or lock-up agreements to sell shares prior to the
expiration of the lock-up period. After the end of the lock-up period, all
shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2019
will become eligible for sale, of which 83,045,414 shares held

by directors, executive officers and other affiliates will be subject to
volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act) and various vesting agreements.

In addition, as of January 31, 2019, there were 35,064,465 shares of Class B
common stock subject to outstanding options. We intend to register all of the
shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Class
B common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and upon exercise
or settlement of any options or other equity incentives we may grant in the
future for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares
will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent such options
are exercised, subject to the lock-up agreements described above and
compliance with applicable securities laws.

As of January 31, 2019, holders of 156,171,668 shares of our Class B common
stock, including shares issuable upon the conversion of outstanding shares of
preferred stock, have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to
file registration statements for the public resale of the Class A common stock
issuable upon conversion of such shares or to include such shares in
registration statements that we may file on our behalf or for other
stockholders. See Shares Eligible for Future Sale and Underwriters.

**_Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may
prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management or
hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price
of our Class  A common stock may be lower as a result. _**

There are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as they
will be in effect following this offering, that may make it difficult for a
third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Zoom, even if a
change in control was considered favorable by our stockholders.

Our charter documents will also contain other provisions that could have an
anti-takeover effect, such as:



  |  |   |

establishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our
board of directors are elected at one time;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

permitting the board of directors to establish the number of directors and
fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

providing that directors may only be removed for cause;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

prohibiting cumulative voting for directors;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

requiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of
incorporation and bylaws;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board of
directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of
stockholders;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all
stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

our dual class common stock structure as described above.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
Moreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the
provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which
prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from
merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the
transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding
voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed
manner. Any provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or
Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control
could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for
their shares of our Class A common stock and could also affect the price that
some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.

**_Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will designate the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the
federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive
forums for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit
our stockholders  ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us
or our directors, officers or employees. _**

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which will become
effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering, will provide
that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum,
the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings
under Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach
of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees
to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision
of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the certificate of incorporation
or the amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim
that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have
jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all
cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties
named as defendants. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation will provide that the federal district courts of the United
States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint
asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and
contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the
enforceability of such exclusive forum provision.

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of
our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these
provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholders ability
to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or
our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits
against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to
find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may
incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other
jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations. For example, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently determined that the
exclusive forum provision of federal district courts of the United States of
America for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under
the Securities Act is not enforceable. However, this decision may be reviewed
and ultimately overturned by the Delaware Supreme Court. If this ultimate
adjudication were to occur, we would enforce the federal district court
exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation.

**_Our Class  A common stock market price and trading volume could decline if
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate
or unfavorable research about our business. _**

The trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the
research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or
our business. The analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and
are often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the
analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate
or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would
likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one
or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on
us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the
price and trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.

**_We will incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying
with the laws and regulations affecting public companies in the United States,
which may harm our business._**

As a public company listed in the United States, we will incur significant
additional legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, changing laws,
regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public
disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock
Market, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some
activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are
subject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in
practice may evolve over time



42

##### Table of Contents

as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to
invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and
this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses
and a diversion of managements time and attention from revenue-generating
activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail
to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, regulatory authorities may
initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.

Failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to
obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability
insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage
or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage.
The impact of these events would also make it more difficult for us to attract
and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees
of our board of directors or as members of senior management.

**_We are an emerging growth company, and we intend to comply only with
reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies. As a
result, our Class A common stock could be less attractive to investors. _**

We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act, and for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company,
we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting
requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth
companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced
disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding
a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval
of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an
emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal
year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering,
(b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of over $1.07 billion or (c)
in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market
value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of
the prior July 31 and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0
billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We cannot
predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive if we
choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common
stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure,
there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock, and
our stock price may be more volatile.

**_We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future._**

We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We
currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and
expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any
dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on
sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation as the only way
to realize any future gains on their investment.

**SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This prospectus contains forward-looking statements about us and our industry
that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than
statements of historical facts contained in this prospectus, including
statements regarding our future results of operations or financial condition,
business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future
operations, including our statements regarding the benefits and timing of the
roll-out of new technology, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you
can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as
anticipate, believe, contemplate, continue, could, estimate,
expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project,
should, target, will or would or the negative of these words or other
similar terms or expressions.

You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future
events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this
prospectus primarily on our current expectations and projections about future
events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition
and operating results. The outcome of the events described in these forward-
looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors
described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this
prospectus. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of our Class A common stock
that we are offering and the concurrent private placement will be
approximately $434.5 million (or approximately $541.5 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full), based on the
initial public offering price of $36.00 per share of Class A common stock,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses
related to the offering and the concurrent private placement. We will not
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A common stock by
the selling stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility and create a public market for our Class A common stock.
We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering and
the concurrent private placement for general corporate purposes, including
working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. We cannot
specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the remaining net
proceeds to us from this offering and the concurrent private placement. We may
also use a portion of the net proceeds for acquisitions or strategic
investments in complementary businesses, products, services or technologies.
However, we do not have agreements or commitments to enter into any such
acquisitions or investments at this time. We will have broad discretion over
how to use the net proceeds to us from this offering. We intend to invest the
net proceeds to us from the offering and the concurrent private placement that
are not used as described above in investment-grade, interest-bearing
instruments.

**DIVIDEND POLICY**

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We
currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to
fund the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate
paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination
regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the
discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing
conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual
restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our
board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, we may enter into
agreements in the future that could contain restrictions on payments of cash
dividends.

**DILUTION**

If you invest in our Class A common stock in this offering, your ownership
interest will be immediately diluted to the extent of the difference between
the initial public offering price per share and the pro forma as adjusted net
tangible book value per share of our Class A common stock after this offering
and the concurrent private placement.

As of January 31, 2019, we had a pro forma net tangible book value (deficit)
of $165.3 million, or $0.68 per share. Pro forma net tangible book value per
share represents the amount of our total tangible assets less our total
liabilities, divided by the number of shares of our Class A and Class B common
stock outstanding as of January 31, 2019, after giving effect to the
reclassification and automatic conversion of all shares of our convertible
preferred stock outstanding as of January 31, 2019 into 152,665,804 shares of
our Class B common stock.

After giving further effect to the sale of 12,689,211 shares of Class A common
stock that we are offering and the concurrent private placement at the initial
public offering price of $36.00 per share, as well as the issuance of 283,177
shares of Class A common stock (as converted) upon exercise of options held by
certain selling stockholders, and after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated expenses related to the offering and the concurrent
private placement payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book
value as of January 31, 2019 would have been approximately $600.0 million, or
approximately $2.34 per share. This amount represents an immediate increase in
pro forma net tangible book value of $1.66 per share to our existing
stockholders and an immediate dilution in pro forma net tangible book value of
approximately $33.66 per share to new investors purchasing shares of Class A
common stock in this offering and the concurrent private placement.

Dilution per share to new investors is determined by subtracting pro forma as
adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering from the
initial public offering price per share paid by new investors. The following
table illustrates this dilution (without giving effect to any exercise by the
underwriters of their over-allotment option):



|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  
Initial public offering price per share

offering and the concurrent private placement

Dilution per share to new investors in this offering and the concurrent
private placement

|    |  |  |  |    | $ | 33.66 |  
|    |  |  |  |    |



|



|  
  
If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, the pro
forma as adjusted net tangible book value after the offering and the
concurrent private placement would be $2.72 per share, the increase in pro
forma net tangible book value per share to existing stockholders would be
$2.05 per share and the dilution per share to new investors would be $33.28
per share, in each case based on the initial public offering price of $36.00
per share.

The following table summarizes on the pro forma as adjusted basis described
above, as of January 31, 2019, the differences between the number of shares of
Class B common stock purchased from us by our existing stockholders and Class
A common stock by new investors purchasing shares in this offering and the
concurrent private placement, the total consideration paid to us in cash and
the average price per share paid by existing stockholders for shares of Class
B common stock issued prior to this offering and the price to be paid by new
investors for shares of Class A common stock in this offering and the
concurrent private placement. The calculation below is based on the initial
public offering price of $36.00 per share, before deducting underwriting

Sales by the selling stockholders in this offering will reduce the number of
shares held by existing stockholders to 232,741,029, or approximately 90.8% of
the total shares of common stock outstanding after this offering and the
concurrent private placement, and will increase the number of shares held by
new investors (including the concurrent private placement investor) to
23,647,342, or approximately 9.2% of the total shares of common stock
outstanding after this offering and the concurrent private placement.

The outstanding share information in the table above is based on 422,744
shares of our Class A common stock (including the conversion of convertible
promissory notes) and 242,993,239 shares of our Class B common stock
(including preferred stock on an as-converted basis and reclassified as Class
B common stock) outstanding as of January 31, 2019 and excludes:



  |  |   |

2019), which will become effective in connection with this offering, including
34,000,000 new shares plus the number of shares (not to exceed 24,300,889
shares) (i) that remain available for grant of future awards under our 2011

**MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS **

_The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations should be read together with our consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere within this
prospectus. This discussion includes both historical information and forward-
looking information that involves risk, uncertainties and assumptions. Our
actual results may differ materially from managements expectations as a
result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in
the section titled Risk Factors. The last day of our fiscal year is January
31. Our fiscal quarters end on April 30, July 31, October 31 and January 31. _

**Overview**

Our mission is to make video communications frictionless.

We provide a video-first communications platform that delivers happiness and
fundamentally changes how people interact. We connect people through
frictionless video, voice, chat and content sharing and enable face-to-face
video experiences for thousands of people in a single meeting across disparate
devices and locations. Our cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-
quality video that is easy to use, manage and deploy, provides an attractive
return on investment, is scalable and easily integrates with physical spaces
and applications. We believe that rich and reliable communications lead to
interactions that build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the
trust our customers place in us by delivering a communications solution that
just works. Our goal is to make Zoom meetings better than in-person
meetings.

The positive impact we have on our customers and hosts is reflected in our
average customer Net Promoter Score (NPS), which was over 70 in 2018. NPS,
which can range from a low of -100 to a high of +100, measures the willingness
of customers to recommend a companys products or services to others and is
used as a proxy for gauging customers overall satisfaction with a companys
product or service and the customers loyalty to the brand. We believe our
customer-first focus is a critical part of our DNA and built directly into our
platform architecture, which dynamically processes and delivers reliable,
high-quality video across devices. Our architecture can support tens of
thousands of video participants in a single meeting. Our 13 co-located data
centers located worldwide enable us to provide both high-quality and high-
definition, real-time video to our customers even in low bandwidth
environments.

Since our inception, our consistent focus on innovation has allowed us to
achieve the following significant milestones:

**2011:** Zoom founded, first employee hired, first seed funding and first
office leased

##### Table of Contents

Our revenue was $60.8 million, $151.5 million and $330.5 million for the
fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, representing
annual revenue growth of 149% and 118% in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019,
respectively. We had a net loss of $0.0 million and $3.8 million for the
fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively, and net income of
$7.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019. Cash provided by
operations was $9.4 million, $19.4 million and $51.3 million for the fiscal
years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

**Our Business Model**

We generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our video-first
communications platform. Subscription revenue is driven primarily by the
number of paid hosts, as well as purchases of additional products including
Zoom Rooms and Zoom Video Webinars. A host is any user of our video-first
communications platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting and invites one or more
participants to join that meeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid
Zoom Meeting plan as paid hosts. We define a customer as a separate and
distinct buying entity, which can be a single paid host or an organization of
any size (including a distinct unit of an organization) that has multiple paid
hosts. Our Basic offering is free and gives hosts access to Zoom Meetings with
core features but with limitations on the number of attendees and time. Our
paid offerings include our Pro, Business and Enterprise plans, which provide
incremental features and functionality, such as different participant limits,
administrative controls and reporting.

The terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual and multi-year,
and we may bill for the full term in advance or on an annual or monthly basis,
depending on the customer preference. We recognize subscription revenue
ratably over the term of the subscription period. Our larger customers
typically opt to pay in annual installments, one year in advance. We have seen
an increase in the proportion of annual and multi-year subscriptions and
billings as we have increased the number of larger customers. For example, for
the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2019, 65% and 74%, respectively,
of our annual recurring revenue (ARR) was generated from annual and multi-year
subscriptions. We define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of
subscription agreements from all customers at a point in time. We calculate
ARR by taking the monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and multiplying it by 12.
MRR is defined as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription agreements
from all customers for the last month of the period, including revenue from
monthly subscribers who have not provided any indication that they intend to
cancel their subscriptions. The attrition rate for our monthly subscribers was
less than 4% per month in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2019.
ARR and MRR should be viewed independently of revenue as they are operating
metrics and are not intended to be replacements or forecasts of revenue.

**Our Go-to-Market Model **

We offer subscriptions to our platform to a broad range of customers, from
single users to organizations with hundreds of thousands of employees. Users
are comprised of both hosts who organize video meetings and the individual
attendees who participate in those video meetings. We complement this lead-
generation model with our multipronged go-to-market strategy that integrates
the viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal routes-to-market, including
direct sales representatives, online channel, resellers and strategic
partners. This approach allows us to cost-effectively drive upgrades to our
paid offering and expansion within organizations of all sizes and verticals.

Our platform is designed to make it easy for new users to join or host
meetings. Meeting participants invited by a host can begin using the platform
immediately. If a participant wants to host a meeting, they can subscribe to
one of the paid plans or sign up for our free Basic plan. By attracting free
hosts through our Basic plan, we drive usage on our platform, and our free
hosts then introduce and invite new participants to experience the benefits of
Zoom. As free hosts realize the benefits of our platform, they often subscribe
to a paid plan to gain access to additional functionality. For the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2019, 55% of our 344 customers that contributed more than
$100,000 of revenue started with at least one free host prior to subscribing.
These 344 customers contributed 30% of revenue for the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2019.

##### Table of Contents

Our customer base is diverse and spans various industries and countries. Our
top 10 customers accounted for less than 10% of revenue for each of the fiscal
years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.

We have experienced significant success in attracting large enterprise
customers using our model. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, we had
344 customers that contributed more than $100,000 of revenue, compared to just
143 customers one year before.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Performance**

**_Acquiring New Customers_**

We are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our
platform. Our operating results and growth prospects will depend in part on
our ability to attract new customers. While we believe we have a significant
market opportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict
customer adoption rates or the future growth rate and size of the market for
our platform. We will need to continue to invest in sales and marketing in
order to address this opportunity by hiring, developing and retaining talented
sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity levels in a
reasonable period of time.

**_Expansion of Zoom Across Existing Customers_**

We believe that there is a large opportunity for growth with many of our
existing customers. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, greater than
50% of the Fortune 500 had at least one paid Zoom host, compared to only 4%
that contributed more than $100,000 of revenue. We believe this demonstrates
that our product has already gained a foothold in many of the largest
enterprises in the United States, and there is a large opportunity to expand
within these large enterprise customers. Many customers have increased the
size of their subscriptions as they have expanded their use of our platform
across their operations. Some of our larger enterprise customers start with a
single deployment of Zoom Meetings with one team, location or geography,
before rolling out our platform throughout their organization. Several of our
largest customers have deployed our platform globally to their entire
workforce following smaller initial deployments. This expansion in the use of
our platform also provides us with opportunities to market and sell additional
products to our customers, such as Zoom Rooms at each office location and
enablement of Zoom Video Webinars. In order for us to address this opportunity
to expand the use of our products with our existing customers, we will need to
maintain the reliability of our platform and produce new features and
functionality that are responsive to our customers requirements for
enterprise grade solutions.

We quantify our expansion across existing customers through our net dollar
expansion rate. Our net dollar expansion rate includes the increase in user
adoption within our customers, as our subscription revenue is primarily driven
by the number of paid hosts within a customer and the purchase of additional
products, and compares our subscription revenue from the same set of customers
across comparable periods. **** We calculate net dollar expansion rate as of a
period end by starting with the ARR from customers with greater than 10
employees as of the 12 months prior to such period end (Prior Period ARR). We
then calculate the ARR from these customers as of the current period end
(Current Period ARR). The calculation of Current Period ARR includes any
upsells, contraction and attrition. We then divide the total Current Period
ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the net dollar expansion rate.
For the trailing 12-months calculation, we take an average of this calculation
over the previous 12 months. Our net dollar expansion rate may fluctuate as a
result of a number of factors, including the level of penetration within our
customer base, expansion of products and features and our ability to retain
our customers. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate was 138%, 139%
and 140% as of July 31, 2018, October 31, 2018 and January 31, 2019,
respectively. As we only began tracking this metric in August 2017, we are not
able to calculate the net dollar expansion rate for a trailing 12-month period
prior to July 31, 2018.

**_Innovation and Expansion of Our Platform_**

We continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform.
We announced Zoom Phone in October 2018 and made it generally available in
January 2019. In 2018, we also announced our App Marketplace to bring together
applications built by Zoom and third-party developers that are integrated into
our platform, making it easy for customers and developers to extend our
product portfolio with new functionalities. We believe that the more
developers and other third parties use our platform to integrate other major
third-party applications, the more we become the ubiquitous platform for
communications. We will need to expend additional resources to continue
introducing new products, features and functionality, and supporting the
efforts of third parties to enhance the value of our platform with their own
applications.

**_International Expansion_**

Our platform addresses the communications needs of users worldwide. Minimal
updates are required in order to make Zoom available for foreign markets, and
we see international expansion as a major opportunity.

We only recently started to expand our go-to-market operations
internationally. Our revenue from APAC and EMEA represented 17% of our revenue
in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 when we first established a physical
sales presence in Australia and the United Kingdom. In the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2019, our revenue from APAC and EMEA represented 18% of our
revenue, and we added five additional local sales locations in Canada, France,
Japan, the Netherlands and Singapore. We plan to add local sales support in
further select international markets over time. We use strategic partners and
resellers to sell in international markets, such as China, where we have
limited or no sales presence. While we believe global demand for our platform
will continue to increase as international market awareness of Zoom grows, our
ability to conduct our operations internationally will require considerable
management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges
of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple
languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative
dispute systems and commercial markets.

**Key Business Metrics**

We review the following key business metrics to measure our performance,
identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic
decisions.

**_Customers with Greater Than 10 Employees_**

Increasing awareness of our platform and its broad range of capabilities has
enabled us to substantially expand our customer base, which includes
organizations of all sizes across industries. We define a customer as a
separate and distinct buying entity, which can be a single paid host or an
organization of any size (including a distinct unit of an organization) that
has multiple paid hosts. To better distinguish business customers from our
broader customer base, we review the number of customers with more than 10
employees. Revenue from these customers represented 69%, 75% and 78% of
revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019,
respectively. As of January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we had approximately
10,900, 25,800 and 50,800 customers with more than 10 employees. When
disclosing the number of customers, we round down to the nearest hundred.

**_Customers Contributing More Than $100,000 of Annual Revenue_**

We focus on growing the number of customers that contribute more than $100,000
of annual revenue as a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and
attract larger organizations to Zoom. Revenue from these customers represented
22%, 25% and 30% of revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018
and 2019, respectively. As of January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we had 54, 143
and 344 customers that contributed

* * *

##### Table of Contents

more than $100,000 of revenue in each of their respective fiscal years,
demonstrating our rapid penetration of larger organizations including
enterprises. These customers are a subset of the customers with greater than
10 employees.

**Components of Results of Operations**

**_Revenue_**

We derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access
to our video-first communications platform. Our customers do not have the
ability to take possession of our software. We also provide services, which
include professional services, consulting services and online event hosting,
which are generally considered distinct from the access to our video-first
communications platform.

**_Cost of Revenue_**

Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our video-first
communications platform and providing general operating support services to
our customers. These costs are related to our co-located data centers, third-
party cloud hosting, integrated third-party public switched telephone network
(PSTN) services, personnel-related expenses, amortization of capitalized
software development and allocated overhead. We expect our cost of revenue to
increase in absolute dollars as our revenue increases.

**_Operating Expenses_**

_Research and Development_

Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related
expenses directly associated with our research and development organization,
depreciation of equipment used in research and development and allocated
overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We plan to
increase our investment in research and development for the foreseeable future
as we focus on further developing our platform and enhancing its use cases.

_Sales and Marketing_

Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses
directly associated with our sales and marketing organization. Other sales and
marketing expenses include promotional events to promote our brand, such as
awareness programs, digital programs, tradeshows and our user conference,
Zoomtopia, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include
amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs. We plan to increase our
investment in sales and marketing over the foreseeable future, primarily from
increased headcount in our sales force and investment in brand- and product-
marketing efforts.

_General and Administrative_

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related
expenses associated with our finance, legal and human resources organizations,
professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting

ended January 31, 2018 increased by $19.5 million, or 259%, compared to the
fiscal year ended January 31, 2017. The increase in general and administrative
expense was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense
of $8.7 million. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily due to
the sale of common stock by our Chief Executive Officer to an existing
stockholder, which resulted in the recognition of stock-based compensation
expense of $8.6 million for the difference between the purchase price and the
fair value of our common stock at the time of sale. Refer to Note 7 to our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for
more information regarding this transaction. The remainder of the increase was
primarily attributable to increased expenses of $4.0 million related to a
contingent liability for sales and other taxes, $3.3 million in personnel-
related expenses as a result of increased headcount, $1.2 million for external
accounting and consulting services, $0.8 million related to equipment and
software and $0.6 million in allocated overhead. __

ended January 31, 2019 increased by $17.4 million, or 64%, compared to the

expense was primarily due to an increase of $7.8 million in personnel-related
expenses as a result of increased headcount, increased expenses of $7.0
million related to a contingent liability for sales and other taxes, $3.3
million for external accounting and consulting services, $1.3 million in legal
expenses, $1.2 million in bad debt expense, and $1.1 million related to
equipment and software, partially offset by a decrease of $6.0 million in
stock-based compensation expense due to the sale of common stock by our Chief
Executive Officer to an existing stockholder in fiscal 2018, which resulted in
the recognition of stock-based compensation expense of $8.6 million in fiscal
2018. Refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this prospectus for more information regarding this transaction.

**_Quarterly Revenue Trends_**

Revenue increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented primarily due
to sales of subscriptions to new customers and the expanded use of our video-
first communications platform by existing customers. A substantial portion of
the revenue that we report in each period is attributable to the recognition
of deferred revenue related to orders that we received during previous
periods. Consequently, increases or decreases in new sales or renewals in any
one period may not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period and
may impact our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of downturns
in sales and market acceptance of our video-first communications platform with
new customers, and potential changes in our rate of renewals with existing
customers, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until
future periods.

**_Quarterly Cost of Revenue Trends_**

Cost of revenue increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented,
primarily driven by expanded use of our video-first communications platform by
new and existing customers, which resulted in increased costs related to our
co-located data centers, third-party cloud hosting, integrated third-party
PSTN services and personnel-related expenses.

**_Quarterly Gross Profit Trends_**

Gross profit increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented,
primarily driven by an increase in revenue. Our gross profit margins were
consistent for all periods presented.

**_Quarterly Operating Expenses Trends_**

Our total quarterly operating expenses increased sequentially for all periods
presented due primarily to increases in headcount and other related expenses
to support our growth. We intend to continue to make

significant investments in our sales and marketing organization to drive
revenue growth. We have also experienced a seasonal increase in sales and
marketing expenses in our third fiscal quarter due to costs associated with
our user conference Zoomtopia. We also intend to continue investing in our
research and development efforts to add new features to and enhance the
functionality of our existing video-first communications platform, and to
ensure the reliability, availability and scalability of our solutions. As a
result, we anticipate that in future fiscal quarters, the majority of our
research and development expenses will result from personnel-related expenses
and from technology tools used by our engineers in research and development
activities. During our second fiscal quarter in fiscal 2018, we experienced a
significant increase in general and administrative expense due to the sale of
shares of our common stock by our CEO to an existing investor. As a result, we
recognized stock-based compensation expense for the difference between the
purchase price and the fair value of the Companys common stock at the time of
sale. Refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this prospectus for more information regarding this transaction.
General and administrative expenses also include increased costs in recent
fiscal quarters due to preparing to be a public company, a trend that we
expect to continue for the foreseeable future.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

As of January 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities of $176.4 million, which were held for
working capital purposes. Our marketable securities generally consist of high-
grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, agency bonds and U.S. government
agency securities.

Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through sales
of equity securities and cash generated from operations. We also issued
convertible promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million
to two strategic partners. Refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for more information
regarding these transactions. Our principal uses of cash in recent periods
have been funding our operations, investing in capital expenditures and
repurchasing capital stock.

During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2018, we repurchased
4,000,000 and 1,365,800 shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock
from certain stockholders for an aggregate amount of $15.0 million and $4.6
million, respectively, and subsequently retired such shares. Refer to Note 7
to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus
for more information regarding these transactions.

We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities,
together with cash provided by operations, will be sufficient to meet our
needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will
depend on many factors including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal
activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of spending to support
further sales and marketing and research and development efforts, as well as
expenses associated with our international expansion, the timing and extent of
additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces.
We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in
complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual
property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt
financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside
sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all.
If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business,
results of operations and financial condition would be materially and
adversely affected.

**_Operating Activities_**

Net cash provided by operating activities of $9.4 million for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2017 was primarily due to non-cash charges for depreciation
and amortization of $1.2 million, amortization of deferred contract
acquisition costs, primarily commissions, of $3.1 million, stock-based
compensation of $1.0 million and provision for accounts receivable allowances
of $0.3 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were favorable to
cash flows from operations by $3.7 million primarily due to an increase in
deferred revenue of $15.0 million from increases in sales and an increase in
accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $6.6 million,
partially offset by an addition to deferred contract acquisition costs of
$11.2 million, an increase to accounts receivable of $5.9 million due to
increases in sales and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of
$0.9 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $19.4 million for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2018 was primarily due to net loss of $3.8 million, offset
by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $2.8 million,
amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, primarily commissions, of
$9.0 million, stock-based compensation of $10.3 million and provision for
accounts receivable allowances of $0.7 million. Changes in operating assets
and liabilities were favorable to cash flows from operations by $0.3 million
primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $31.5 million from
increases in sales, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses
and other liabilities of $16.3 million, partially offset by an addition to
deferred contract acquisition costs of $27.5 million, an increase to accounts
receivable of $16.6 million due to increases in sales and an increase in
prepaid expenses and other assets of $3.4 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $51.3 million for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2019 was primarily due to net income of $7.6 million, non-
cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $7.0 million, amortization
of deferred contract acquisition costs, primarily commissions, of $20.8
million, stock-based compensation of $8.9 million and provision for accounts
receivable allowances of $2.0 million. Changes in operating assets and
liabilities were favorable to cash flows from operations by $5.0 million
primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $71.5 million due to
increases in sales, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses
and other liabilities of $28.2 million, partially offset by an addition to
deferred contract acquisition costs of $45.8 million, an increase to accounts
receivable of $41.0 million due to increases in sales and an increase in
prepaid expenses and other assets of $8.0 million.

**_Investing Activities_**

Net cash used in investing activities of $2.8 million for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2017 was related to capital expenditures of $4.8 million,
partially offset by principal payment received on a note receivable of $2.0
million. Refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this prospectus for more information regarding the note
receivable.

Net cash used in investing activities of $113.4 million for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2018 was related to net purchases of marketable securities
of $103.6 million and capital expenditures of $9.7 million.

Net cash used in investing activities of $39.7 million for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2019 was related to capital expenditures of $28.4 million,
net purchases of marketable securities of $9.3 million and purchases of
intangible assets of $2.0 million.

**_Financing Activities_**

Net cash provided by financing activities of $100.3 million for the fiscal
year ended January 31, 2017 was primarily related to net proceeds from our
Series D convertible preferred stock financing of $114.8 million, partially
offset by the repurchase of Series A convertible preferred stock of $15.0
million.

##### Table of Contents

Net cash used in financing activities of $4.0 million for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2018 was primarily related to the repurchase of Series A
convertible preferred stock of $4.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from
the exercise of stock options of $0.7 million.

Net cash provided by financing activities of $17.5 million for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2019 was primarily related to the issuance of convertible
promissory notes of $15.0 million and the exercise of stock options of $3.6
million, partially offset by payments of deferred offering costs of $0.9
million.

**Remaining Performance Obligation**

The terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual and multi-year,
and we may bill for the full term in advance or on an annual or monthly basis,
depending on the customer preference. As of January 31, 2019, the aggregate
amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations
was $311.7 million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount
of $125.8 million and unbilled consideration in the amount of $185.9 million
that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 67% of our
remaining performance obligations as revenue in fiscal 2020 and the remainder
thereafter.

**Commitments and Contractual Obligations**

contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in
the table above. ****

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements **

Through January 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with
unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured
finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the
purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually
narrow or limited purposes.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

**_Foreign Currency and Exchange Risk_**

The vast majority of our cash generated from revenue are denominated in U.S.
dollars, with a small amount denominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses
are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we
conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States, China,
Europe and Australia. Our results of current and future operations and cash
flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign
currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a
material impact on our historical consolidated financials for the fiscal years
ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019. As the impact of foreign currency
exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating results, we
have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in
the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more significant.

##### Table of Contents

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We had cash and cash equivalents of $63.6 million and marketable securities of
$112.8 million as of January 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents consist of
bank deposits and money market funds. Our marketable securities generally
consist of high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, agency bonds and U.S.
government agency securities. The cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities are held for working capital purposes. Such interest-earning
instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The primary objective of our
investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without
significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or
speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to
manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-term nature of our
investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed
to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change
in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a
material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the
fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those accounting policies and
estimates that are both the most important to the portrayal of our net assets
and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates are developed
based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are
accounting estimates where the nature of the estimates are material due to the
levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain
matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the
estimates on financial condition or operating performance is material.

The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe
have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are
described below. ** __**

**_Revenue Recognition_**

__**__****__**____We derive our revenue from subscription agreements with
customers for access to our video-first communications platform and services.
We elected to adopt Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606,
_Revenue from Contracts with Customers_ (ASC 606), effective as of February 1,
2017, utilizing the full retrospective method of adoption. Accordingly, the
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017,
2018 and 2019 are presented under ASC 606.

In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains
control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the
consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services. To
achieve the core principle of this standard, we apply the following five
steps:

_1\. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer_

We determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is
approved, each partys rights regarding the services to be transferred can be
identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer
has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance.
At contract inception, we will evaluate whether two or more contracts should
be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or
single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply
judgment in determining the customers ability and intent to pay, which is
based on a variety of factors, including the customers historical payment
experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information
pertaining to the customer.

_2\. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract_

Performance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the
services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of
being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either



70

* * *

##### Table of Contents

on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from
third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract,
whereby the transfer of the services and the products is separately
identifiable from other promises in the contract. Our performance obligations
generally consist of access to our video-first communications platform and
related support services which is considered one performance obligation. Our
customers do not have the ability to take possession of our software, and
through access to our platform we provide a series of distinct software-based
services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription.

We also provide services, which include professional services, consulting
services and online event hosting, which are generally considered distinct
from the access to our video-first communications platform.

_3\. Determination of the transaction price_

The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we
expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer.
Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our
judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative
revenue recognized under the contract will not occur. None of our contracts
contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any
taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental
entities (e.g., sales and other indirect taxes).

Our video-first communications platform and related support services are
typically warranted to perform in a professional manner that will comply with
the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include service
level commitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime
reliability and performance and permitting those customers to receive credits
in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits
represent a form of variable consideration. Historically, we have not
experienced any significant incidents affecting the defined levels of
reliability and performance as required by the subscription agreements. We
have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements in the
consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.

_4\. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the
contract_

Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation
of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on each
performance obligations relative standalone selling price. As noted above,
access to our video-first communications platform and related support services
are considered one performance obligation in the context of the contract and
accordingly the transaction price is allocated to this single performance
obligation.

_5\. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is
satisfied_

Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is
satisfied by transferring the control of the promised service to a customer.
Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we
expect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our
video-first communications platform and related support services are
subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation and the
related revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period as we
satisfy the performance obligation.

Services are time-based arrangements and revenue is recognized as these
services are performed.

**_Contract Balances_**

We receive payments from customers based on a billing schedule as established
in our customer contracts. Accounts receivable are recorded when we
contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right
to consideration for our performance under the contract may occur before
invoicing to the customer resulting in an unbilled accounts receivable.



71

* * *

##### Table of Contents

Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we
have the right to invoice in advance of performance under a customer contract.
The current portion of deferred revenue balances are recognized during the
following 12-month period.

**Cost to Obtain a Contract**

We capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal
sales personnel that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts.
These costs are recorded as deferred contract acquisition costs on the
consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred
based on our sales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental
and would not have occurred absent the customer contract.

Sales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are
amortized over an estimated period of benefit of three years, which is
typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts. We do
not pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on
a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. We
determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of
the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial
estimated customer life and the technological life of our video-first
communications platform and related significant features. Amortization of
deferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense
in the consolidated statements of operations.

**_Stock-Based Compensation_**

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock awards is recognized based
on the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of each option award
is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the
expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our
common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our
common stock. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the option
awards represent managements best estimates. These estimates involve inherent
uncertainties and the application of managements judgment. The related stock-
based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period of the awards, which is generally four years. We
account for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating the number of
awards expected to be forfeited.

Our use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions. If factors change and different assumptions are used,
our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the
future.

These assumptions and estimates are as follows:



  |  |   |

_Fair Value of Common Stock._ As our common stock is not publicly traded, the
fair value was determined by our board of directors, with input from
management and valuation reports prepared by third-party valuation
specialists. Stock-based compensation for financial reporting purposes is
measured based on updated estimates of fair value when appropriate, such as
when additional relevant information related to the estimate becomes available
in a valuation report issued as of a subsequent date.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

_Risk-Free Interest Rate._ The risk-free interest rate for the expected term
of the options was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
time of the grant. __  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

_Expected Term._ The expected term of options represents the period of time
that options are expected to be outstanding. Our historical stock option
exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate
an expected term due to a lack of sufficient data. For stock options granted
to  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


72

##### Table of Contents

  |

employees, we estimate the expected term by using the simplified method. The
simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-
vesting and the contractual life of the options. For stock options granted to
non-employees, the expected term equals the contractual term of the option.  
  
---|---  
  


  |  |   |

_Expected Volatility._ As we do not have a trading history for our common
stock, the expected volatility was estimated by taking the average historic
price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public companies in
our industry which are either similar in size, stage of life cycle, or
financial leverage, over a period equivalent to the expected term of the
awards.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

_Expected Dividend Yield._ We have never declared or paid any cash dividends
and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As
a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
The Black-Scholes assumptions used in evaluating our awards are as follows:



|  |  |  |  |  |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  |    | **Year Ended January  31,**  
  |    | **2017** |    | **2018** |    | **2019**  
  
Expected term (years)

|    | 5.4  6.1 |    | 5.6  6.7 |    | 5.0  6.2  
  
Expected volatility

|    | 48.2%  56.3% |    | 47.7%  52.0% |    | 44.6%  48.2%  
  
Risk-free interest rate

|    | 1.2%  1.5% |    | 1.8%  2.3% |    | 2.6%  3.1%  
  
Expected dividend yield

|    | 0.0% |    | 0.0% |    | 0.0%  
  
We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our
stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate
additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimation
process, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation
expense.

**_Common Stock Valuations_**

In valuing our common stock, the fair value of our business, or enterprise
value, was determined using either the market approach or a combination of the
market and income approaches. The market approach estimates value based on a
comparison of the subject company to comparable public companies in a similar
line of business and secondary transactions of our capital stock. From the
comparable companies, a representative market value multiple is determined and
then applied to the subject companys financial results to estimate the value
of the subject company. The market approach also includes consideration of the
transaction price of secondary sales of our capital stock by investors. The
income approach estimates the fair value of a company based on the present
value of the companys future estimated cash flows and the residual value of
the company beyond the forecast period. These future cash flows, including the
cash flows beyond the forecast period for the residual value, are discounted
to their present values using an appropriate discount rate, to reflect the
risks inherent in the company achieving these estimated cash flows.

The resulting equity value is then allocated to each class of stock using an
Option Pricing Model (OPM). The OPM treats common stock and convertible
preferred stock as call options on an equity value, with exercise prices based
on the liquidation preference of our convertible preferred stock. The common
stock is modeled as a call option with a claim on the equity value at an
exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after our convertible
preferred stock is liquidated. The exclusive reliance on the OPM through July
31, 2018 was appropriate when the range of possible future outcomes was
difficult to predict and resulted in a highly speculative forecast. Beginning
in October 2018, we performed the equity allocation using a probability
weighted expected return method, or PWERM. The PWERM involves the estimation
of the value of our company under multiple future potential outcomes, and
estimates the probability of each potential outcome. The per share value of
our common stock when determined using the PWERM was ultimately based upon
probability-weighted per share values resulting from the various future
scenarios, which include an initial public offering, merger or sale, or
continued operation as a private company. After the equity value was
determined and allocated to the various



73

* * *

##### Table of Contents

classes of shares, a discount for lack of marketability (DLOM) was applied to
arrive at the fair value of common stock on a non-marketable basis. A DLOM is
applied based on the theory that as an owner of a private company stock, the
stockholder has limited information and opportunities to sell this stock. A
market participant that would purchase this stock would recognize this risk
and thereby require a higher rate of return, which would reduce the overall
fair market value.

Our assessments of the fair value of common stock for grant dates were based
in part on the current available financial and operational information and the
common stock value provided in the most recent valuation as compared to the
timing of each grant. For financial reporting purposes, we considered the
amount of time between the valuation date and the grant date to determine
whether to use the latest common stock valuation or a straight-line
interpolation between the two valuation dates. This determination included an
evaluation of whether the subsequent valuation indicated that any significant
change in valuation had occurred between the previous valuation and the grant
date.

**_Preliminary Offering Price and Options Granted in January 2019 and
Subsequent to January 31, 2019_**

Subsequent to January 31, 2019, we granted stock options to purchase up to
1,324,650 shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of
$27.42 per share which generally vest over a period of 48 months. Based on the
initial public offering price, we estimate we will recognize approximately
$29.0 million of stock-based compensation expense related to these stock
options generally over the requisite service period of 48 months.

In addition, in light of the difference between the fair value used for stock
options granted on January 24, 2019 and the initial public offering price, in
order to determine the appropriate share-based compensation expense for those
stock options for financial reporting purposes, we reassessed the share-based
compensation expense using the initial public offering price. We are
recognizing $19.3 million of stock-based compensation expense related to these
option grants generally over the requisite service period of 48 months. Since
these options were granted near the end of fiscal 2019, the amount of stock-
based compensation expense recognized in that fiscal period for these stock
option grants is immaterial, and the incremental amount of additional expense
in fiscal 2019 as a result of this reassessment using the initial public
offering price is also immaterial. Therefore, we will record an out-of-period
adjustment in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to catch-up the incremental
amount of additional expense for these stock option grants that would have
otherwise been recorded in fiscal 2019.

The amount of stock-based compensation expense related to these option grants
is preliminary and unaudited, based upon our estimates, and subject to further
internal review by our management and compilation of actual results. We have
provided an estimate for this expense primarily because we have not completed
the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and therefore, we have not started, much
less completed, our closing procedures for the quarter. Our managements
estimates are based upon information currently available and could change as a
result of the final offering price or other factors. While we expect that our
estimate of stock-based compensation expense related to these option grants is
reasonable based on all information currently available, our actual expense
may differ materially from these preliminary estimates.

Upon the completion of this offering, our common stock will be publicly traded
and we will rely on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the
date of grant to determine the fair value of our common stock.

**_Derivative Liabilities_**

The fair value of the derivative liabilities were measured using a with-and-
without approach. Inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of the
derivative instruments include the probability estimates of potential
settlement scenarios for the convertible promissory notes, a present value
discount rate and an estimate of the



74

* * *

##### Table of Contents

expected timing of settlement. Certain unobservable inputs used in the fair
value measurement of the derivative instruments associated with the
convertible promissory notes are the scenario probabilities and the discount
rate estimated at the valuation date.

**JOBS Act Accounting Election**

We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act (JOBS Act). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can
delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the
enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private
companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this
exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and therefore, we will be
subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public
companies that are not emerging growth companies.

**A LETTER FROM ERIC S. YUAN**

Thank you for reading our prospectus and considering an investment in Zoom. As
the founder and CEO of Zoom, it is my privilege to share with you what were
all about.

Life is about the pursuit of happiness. The greatest, most sustainable
happiness comes from making others happy. Delivering happiness is what we do
at Zoom.

Ten years ago, I was an engineering leader at a major technology company. I
would visit customers, and they would tell me how unhappy they were with the
technology in the videoconferencing market. This made me unhappy. There had to
be something better  something designed for modern video communications,
something that would deliver happiness. I knew that we would have to start
from scratch to do it right.

This experience underlies the Zoom happiness philosophy. Our focus is to keep
both our customers and our employees happy. The sum of their joy is greater
than its parts. Our customers and our employees make each other happy. We live
this philosophy every day. We take care of our customers and employees. We
built a video-first communications platform that is scalable, user friendly
and reliable. We respond to our customers emails (quickly), talk with them
face-to-face on Zoom, really listen to them and build the features and
products they ask for (also quickly).

Happiness delivers results. In 2018, our average customer Net Promoter Score
was over 70, demonstrating that our high-quality, easy-to-use platform is
making customers happy. We have consistently earned high scores across
customer review sites, including Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius and G2
Crowd. And lets not forget our employees. Zoom has received multiple awards
from Glassdoor based on high ratings and reviews from our employees.

We deliver much more than what people expect from video communications. Our
team comes to work every day because our platform transforms the way people
work together. For example, a medical care team discusses the plan to
transition a pediatric patient off his feeding tube, the worlds largest
brewery explores opportunities for using blockchain to pay its farmers, a
state park brings students on an underwater exploration in Lake Tahoe  all
face-to-face on Zoom. We are proud that our platform helps users around the
world build trust, strengthen relationships, move faster and get meaningful
things done.

Its been over seven years since I founded Zoom, but this is just the
beginning. There are a lot of people and companies that benefit from Zoom, but
there are still plenty that havent yet explored the possibilities that Zoom
can bring to their organizations. I want to give them video communications
that make them happy. Video is the future of communications. If our customers
are happy, the skys the limit. We must stay humble and paranoid about our
customers and employees happiness.

We have a lot left to do. If you join us in this journey, you will become an
integral part of this work and our family. Caring is our companys core value.
We care deeply for our community, our customers, our team and our company. And
today, we want to add you to that list.

And now, back to work, and back to making people happy,

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

Our mission is to make video communications frictionless.

We provide a video-first communications platform that delivers happiness and
fundamentally changes how people interact. We connect people through
frictionless video, voice, chat and content sharing and enable face-to-face
video experiences for thousands of people in a single meeting across disparate
devices and locations. Our cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-
quality video that is easy to use, manage and deploy, provides an attractive
return on investment, is scalable and easily integrates with physical spaces
and applications. We believe that rich and reliable communications lead to
interactions that build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the
trust our customers place in us by delivering a communications solution that
just works. Our goal is to make Zoom meetings better than in-person
meetings.

We believe that our platform transforms how organizations communicate and work
to create opportunities that were not possible before. We are witnessing the
rapid adoption of video communications inside traditional organizations,
enabling far greater effectiveness and intimacy in human-to-human interactions
over a distance. In addition, we are enabling new use cases for how people are
carrying out their work. For example, a technology customer with approximately
1,000 employees has been able to grow and maintain its culture even with an
all-remote employee base by running all of its meetings on Zoom. A hospital,
using Zoom, has been able to reduce the number of and time in surgeries by
connecting specialists live into the operating room. A university uses Zoom to
encourage participation and inclusion for students in its night program who
have family and work constraints that would otherwise prevent them from
participating in class.

We believe that our customers are delighted when they use our platform. Since
our founding in 2011, our platform has been used to conduct tens of billions
of meeting minutes. We believe that our success results from a culture that is
focused on customer and employee happiness, a video-first cloud architecture,
recognized market leadership, viral demand, an efficient go-to-market strategy
and robust customer support.

Our architecture is video-first, cloud-native and optimized to dynamically
process and deliver reliable, high-quality video across devices. Our approach
to video has been substantially different from that taken by others who have
attempted to add video to an aging, pre-existing conference call or chat tool.
We developed a proprietary multimedia router optimized for the cloud that
separates content processing from the transporting and mixing of streams. Our
globally distributed cloud architecture delivers a differentiated user
experience.

The cornerstone of our platform is Zoom Meetings, around which we provide a
full suite of products and features designed to give users a frictionless
communications experience. Users are comprised of both hosts who organize
video meetings and the individual attendees who participate in those video
meetings. Many customers also choose to implement Zoom Rooms, our software-
based conference room system, which enables users to easily experience Zoom
Meetings in their physical meeting spaces. We also recently launched Zoom
Phone, a cloud-based PBX system, which complements Zoom Meetings. Our robust
integrations and partner ecosystem enable organizations to connect Zoom
seamlessly with third-party applications that their employees already use,
reducing friction and increasing employee happiness and productivity.

The happiness we bring is recognized by customers. In 2018, our average
customer Net Promoter Score (NPS) was over 70. Industry analysts also
recognize our market leadership: Gartner has named Zoom a Leader in its Magic
Quadrant for Meeting Solutions based on our ability to execute and
completeness of vision. Zoom also has consistently high scores across
customer review sites, including Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius and G2
Crowd. We have been recognized as a 2018 Gartner Peer Insights Customers
Choice for Meeting Solutions (Web Conferencing). G2 Crowd recognized Zoom as
the leading pacesetter in the industry in its 2018 Momentum Grid of Video
Conferencing.

We have a unique model that combines viral enthusiasm for our platform with a
multipronged go-to-market strategy for optimal efficiency. Viral enthusiasm
begins with our users as they experience our platform  it just works. This
enthusiasm continues as meeting participants become paid hosts and as
businesses of all sizes become our customers. Our sales efforts funnel this
viral demand into routes-to-market that are optimized for each customer
opportunity, which can include our direct sales force, online channel,
resellers and strategic partners. Our sales model allows us to efficiently
turn a single non-paying user into a full enterprise deployment. For the
fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, 55% of our 344 customers that contributed
more than $100,000 of revenue started with at least one free host prior to
subscribing. These 344 customers contributed 30% of revenue in the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2019.

We believe that we have built a scalable and sustainable business model. We
have thousands of customers of all sizes across industry verticals and
geographies. We are experiencing rapid revenue growth and are generating
positive cash flow from operations. Much of the primary capital that we have
raised in recent years remains on our balance sheet, demonstrating the cash
flow efficiency of our business. Our revenue was $60.8 million, $151.5 million
and $330.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019,
respectively, representing annual revenue growth of 149% and 118% for fiscal
2018 and fiscal 2019, respectively. We had a net loss of $0.0 million and $3.8
million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively,
and net income of $7.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019\.
Cash provided by operations was $9.4 million, $19.4 million and $51.3 million
for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

**Industry Trends in Our Favor**

**_Communication is at the Center of Organizational Performance_**

Communication is fundamental for organizations. Effective communication keeps
employees informed, builds trust, engages customers and enhances decision-
making. High-quality communication increases happiness throughout teams and,
when coupled with strong execution, can improve business performance. The
evolving nature of the modern workforce has made communication even more
important than it has been in the past. Fortunately, technological advances
can be harnessed to create richer forms of communication that allow
organizations to increase the happiness and performance of their workforce.

**_Communication and Collaboration Must Evolve as the Nature of Work is
Changing_**

The way people work is changing. Organizations must evolve their approach to
communication and collaboration in response to the following trends:



  |  |   |

**_Employees are increasingly distributed_**. Historically, teams were
physically located together, even in the largest organizations, to drive
productivity. Mobile and cloud technologies and ubiquitous network
connectivity have enabled modern organizations to be increasingly distributed.
Employees are asking to work remotely, and employers are targeting the best
talent regardless of their location. Even though teams are more geographically
distributed, it is still critical for them to work together effectively.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Organizations seek to drive deeper engagement with employees, customers and
partners_** _._ People derive more personal satisfaction and are more
productive when they engage at a deeper level across internal and external
business relationships. Historically, this was done through live, in-person
interactions. With increasingly distributed workforces, maintaining this level
of engagement is difficult. Outside of the workplace, video has become an
increasingly popular medium by which people interact with their friends and
family. Video is a rich form of interaction as it allows the communication of
facial expressions, emotions, body language and the surrounding environment.
However, the lack of reliable business solutions has limited the adoption of
video in the workplace.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Workforce demographics are changing._** Shifting demographics alongside
increasingly distributed workforces increase the need for effective ways to
communicate beyond in-person meetings. For

example, millennials currently make up 35% of the U.S. workforce. This
population values agility and flexibility in their work environment, and
millennials expect technology to meet their needs and work seamlessly.  
  
---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Employees are influencing IT decisions_** _._ Employees are increasingly
the primary force for IT modernization at work as they bring the latest
technologies from their personal lives to their jobs. According to a 2017
report from Salesforce Research, 71% of employees want their companies to
provide the same level of technology as they use in their personal lives.
Employees often expect to seamlessly communicate on any device and across
mediums and, as a result, are increasingly influencing IT decisions.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
**_Organizations Need a Comprehensive Platform that Enables Modern
Communication_**

Legacy approaches to workplace communication have failed to address the
evolving nature of work. Legacy communication tools have been ineffective due
to substandard technology, expensive deployments, complicated interfaces and
aging, proprietary architectures. Many were built largely to support audio
conference calls and were designed to run on-premises. Additionally, many
legacy video services were built as an extension of an existing tool and are,
therefore, not purpose-built to enable a high quality and reliable user
experience.

This dynamic has resulted in organizations deploying disparate and siloed
technologies to address each of the various ways in which people communicate,
including video, voice, email, chat and content sharing. According to a 2017
study by Forbes Media LLC that we commissioned, 62% of organizations use three
or more video conferencing solutions to address different communications
needs. These disparate technologies are difficult for employees to adopt and
navigate and cumbersome and expensive for IT to support and manage.

To effectively enable modern communication, a comprehensive platform must have
the following qualities:



  |  |   |

**_Reliable, high-quality communications_** _._ Organizations have a
significant need for a platform that reliably delivers high-quality video and
voice, even with varying levels of network performance. Legacy approaches
generally do not adequately optimize the quality of the video based on
bandwidth or device. This deficiency can result in dropped calls, pixelated
video and unsynchronized audio and video.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Easy to use_** _._ To drive broad adoption, a platforms user interface
must be intuitive and easily navigable. In addition, users want solutions that
have feature parity across devices and seamlessly integrate with their
calendars, contacts and overall workflows. Multiple disparate legacy systems
can be difficult for users to learn as they require product-specific
knowledge, multiple passwords and understanding of overly complicated
features, making them suboptimal.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Easy to deploy and manage_** _._ Organizations want a single platform that
is easy to deploy, leverages existing network infrastructure and conference
room hardware and is simple to manage at scale through an intuitive
administrative console and reporting system. IT deployment of disparate tools
for video, voice, chat and content sharing that do not easily integrate with
each other dramatically increases cost and complexity. Moreover, frequent
manual updates, redundant products, constant troubleshooting and requirements
for extensive user support make these tools difficult to manage.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Attractive return on investment_** _._ Legacy systems often require
significant proprietary infrastructure and conference room investments.
Additionally, these systems may have unpredictable pricing based on usage that
can vary from month to month. Organizations want a single platform that not
only reduces the costs of proprietary infrastructure and conference room
investments but also provides other opportunities for further cost savings,
such as reducing unnecessary and expensive business travel.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Scalability_** _._ Organizations need a communications platform that can be
optimized for their footprint and scales as they grow. Legacy approaches often
require cumbersome infrastructure and stitching together of disparate systems
to support a growing user base. Moreover, many legacy systems simply cannot
meet the demands of large enterprises.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


79

* * *

##### Table of Contents

  |  |   |

**_Integrated._** Organizations need a platform that integrates with their
physical workspaces and existing business applications. Most legacy approaches
were not designed to integrate easily with modern software applications or
third-party devices, which can result in a frustrating experience.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Flexible terms_** _._ Organizations also want to purchase technology under
flexible terms that are right-sized for their business needs. Legacy offerings
generally have rigid purchase contracts and support terms.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
Organizations need a communications platform that delivers reliable, high-
quality video that is easy to use, manage and deploy, provides an attractive
return on investment, is scalable and easily integrates with physical spaces
and applications.

**Our Platform**

We provide a video-first communications platform that delivers happiness and
fundamentally changes how people interact by connecting them through
frictionless video, voice, chat and content sharing. Our cloud-native platform
enables face-to-face video experiences and connects thousands of users across
disparate devices and locations in a single meeting. We strive to make Zoom
meetings better than in-person meetings. Our customers typically see a
dramatic increase in video communications usage after deployment. For example,
prior to 2014, BAYADA Home Health Care was averaging just under 100 meetings a
week using several applications for video conferencing prior to Zoom. Now with
Zoom, it averaged 2,000 Zoom meetings a week in 2018.

removes the need for the integration of disparate communications tools,
product-specific knowledge and high-touch user support and troubleshooting. We
provide a simple and robust management layer with reporting capability.  
  
---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Attractive return on investment_** **.** Our platform drives higher
employee engagement and improved collaboration, resulting in increased
organizational productivity. Switching to our platform also reduces the costs
associated with expensive on-premises infrastructure and continual
maintenance. Moreover, the reliability of our platforms free voice over
internet protocol (VoIP) provides our customers with considerable cost savings
when compared to the public switched telephone network. The quality of the
user experience provided by our platform makes it a compelling alternative to
in-person meetings.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Scalability._** Our cloud-native platform was purpose-built to scale with
organizations as they grow in size and complexity. Our platform delivers the
highest quality experience for organizations of all sizes and for meetings,
whether with two or thousands of users. Organizations can confidently scale
their deployment of our platform with the assurance that it will continue to
serve their needs as their operations grow.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Integrated._** Our robust integrations and partner ecosystem enable
organizations to connect our platform seamlessly with both existing physical
workspaces and business applications that their employees already use,
allowing them to choose the most natural medium for any part of an
interaction. For example, our platform integrates with cloud software
applications provided by companies such as Atlassian, Dropbox, Google,
LinkedIn, Microsoft, salesforce.com, Slack and others. We also have an
ecosystem of hardware partners through which we deploy our Zoom Rooms and
Conference Room Connector offerings.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Flexible terms._** We allow organizations to purchase subscriptions to our
communications platform that are right-sized for their business needs.
Customers can subscribe to our communications platform based on the number of
hosts that they require on a month-to-month basis or purchase one- to multi-
year subscriptions. In general, customers are not obligated to extend the term
of their subscriptions beyond the contract term and can cancel their
subscriptions at any time, although any amounts owed under the contract term
remain due and payable. We are not obligated to provide refunds for services
for which payment has already been made. The average term for our multi-year
contracts is 2.4 years.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages that will enable us
to maintain and extend our leadership in communications. Our competitive
strengths include:



  |  |   |

**_Video-first cloud architecture._** We built our platform from the ground up
to be cloud-native and video-first, unlike other approaches that have
attempted to add video to an aging, pre-existing conference call or chat tool.
We developed our purpose-built, video-first architecture to achieve the
objective of providing our customers with a high-quality experience. Our
unique architecture was built by our talented team, led by a founding group of
engineers who have extensive expertise in real-time communications technology.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_A recognized market leader_**. We have been recognized by industry analysts
as a market leader. For the third consecutive year, Gartner has named Zoom a
Leader in its Magic Quadrant for Meeting Solutions (previously named Magic
Quadrant for Web Conferencing). Gartner recognized Zoom in the Leaders
quadrant based on our ability to execute and completeness of vision. G2
Crowd recognized Zoom as the leading pacesetter in the industry in its 2018
Momentum Grid of Video Conferencing. Zoom is also Frost & Sullivans 2019
Company of the Year Award recipient for the Global Video Conferencing
Industry.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Viral demand driven by individual users._** Our rapid adoption is driven by
a virtuous cycle of positive user experiences. Individuals typically begin
using our platform when a colleague or associate invites them to a Zoom
meeting. We allow anyone to join or host a meeting for free. When attendees
experience our platform and realize the benefits, they often become paying
customers to unlock

additional functionality. This user adoption model facilitates user growth and
helps drive penetration within large organizations. The success of our user
adoption model is reflected in our net dollar expansion rate of over 130% for
the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2019.  
  
---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Growing base of happy customers._** We believe that making and keeping
users happy is critical to growing our business. We use NPS data as a
numerical expression of customer happiness. We believe that our customer NPS,
which averaged over 70 in 2018, demonstrates that our high-quality, easy-to-
use platform is making customers happy. We believe that our happy customers
drive viral demand with potential new customers and lead existing customers to
expand the use of our platform.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Multipronged go-to-market strategy._** We have a multipronged, go-to-market
strategy that integrates the viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal
routes-to-market that match the size of the customer opportunity. Our direct
sales force and strategic partners sell to customers of all sizes, and we
leverage our online sales channel for smaller customers. Our platform and
sales model allow us to turn a single non-paying user into a full enterprise
deployment. Many of our customers started with only a single user on the free
version. ** __** For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, 55% of our 344
customers that contributed more than $100,000 of revenue started with at least
one free host prior to subscribing. These 344 customers contributed 30% of
revenue in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, underscoring the power of
our model.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Robust customer support and success function._** We offer 24/7/365 support
through live chat, phone and video for paying customers. Free customers have
the ability to chat or open tickets with our support team. Additionally, we
offer a variety of support options on our website, including a comprehensive
knowledge base, to all customers. Our customer success team provides
customized onboarding, training, branding, implementation and development
solutions for our larger customers. Additionally, we regularly use customer
feedback to drive further innovation on our platform. For the 90-day period
ended January 31, 2019, our customer support team had a customer satisfaction
score (CSAT) of over 90%.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
**Our Culture of Happiness**

We are focused on delivering happiness to our employees and customers. We
strive to change the way business is done through our communications
technology and our company culture. We take happiness so seriously that we
have an employee-led happiness committee and crew to facilitate and amplify
our efforts to deliver happiness to our employees and customers.

Our culture of delivering happiness drives our mission, vision and values and
is fundamental to everything we do at Zoom:



  |  |   |

**_Mission_**. Our mission is to make video communications frictionless.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Vision._** Our vision is to empower people to accomplish more through video
communications.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Values_**. We care for our community, our customers, our company, our
teammates and ourselves.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
This culture supports our hiring and serves as a competitive advantage in
attracting and retaining top talent. Our Chief Executive Officer received
Glassdoors #1 CEO of a large company award in 2018, and we placed #2 in
Glassdoors Best Places to Work in the large company category in 2019.

**Our Market Opportunity**

Video has increasingly become the way that individuals want to communicate in
the workplace and their daily lives. As a result, it has become a fundamental
component of todays communication and collaboration market, which also
includes integrated voice, chat and content sharing. IDC has defined this
market as Unified Communications and Collaboration. Within this market, we
address the Hosted / Cloud Voice and Unified Communications, Collaborative
Applications and IP Telephony Lines segments. IDC estimated that these
segments combined represent a $43.1 billion opportunity in 2022.



83

* * *

##### Table of Contents

We believe we address a broader opportunity than is currently captured in
third-party market research because once our customers begin to experience the
benefits of our video-first communications platform, they tend to greatly
expand their use of video throughout their organizations. As a result, we
expect that use of our platform will significantly increase the penetration of
video communications across a broad range of customer types and use cases. We
believe that all of todays information workers could benefit from our
platforms ability to connect people through frictionless video, voice, chat
and content sharing. According to a Forrester Consulting report commissioned
by Morgan Stanley, there were 1.25 billion information workers globally in
2018.

**Our Growth Strategy**

We focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth:



  |  |   |

**_Keep our existing customers happy._** We provide happiness to our customers
by giving them an experience that delights them. We respond to customer needs
with action to drive positive user experiences. We believe these practices
result in our high NPS and will continue to generate referrals from our
existing customers, providing meaningful viral adoption for the foreseeable
future.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Drive new customer acquisition._** Our platform is designed to make it easy
to host meetings. By attracting free hosts to use our platform, we promote
usage that allows hosts and their meeting attendees to experience the
difference of Zoom. We complement this lead-generation model with our
multipronged go-to-market strategy that integrates the viral enthusiasm for
our platform with optimal routes-to-market, including direct sales
representatives, online channel, resellers and strategic partners. This
approach allows us to cost-effectively drive upgrades to our paid offering and
expansion within organizations of all sizes and verticals.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Expand within existing customers._** As organizations experience our video
platform and become familiar with its benefits, more teams and departments
within these organizations adopt Zoom. Our platform may begin in a line of
business and then organically expand across departments. This land and
expand model has led to some of our largest deployments.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Innovate our platform continuously_**. Our engineers aim to stay on the
cutting edge of video communication and collaboration technologies and release
on average over 200 new and enhanced features a year. We strive to deliver the
best experience to our users by dedicating approximately 20% of engineering
capacity to developing on-demand, customer-requested features that would be
valuable across our customer base.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Accelerate international expansion._** With users, offices and data centers
strategically located around the world, we are poised to reach new customers
globally. Our platform is intuitively designed such that localization
requirements are minimal. For example, our platform works without intensive
translation requirements with only a few language adjustments to our user
interface and support systems.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**_Grow our partnership ecosystem and continue to expand our platform._** Our
platform integrates easily with other systems and tools. We enable developers
to embed our platform into their own offerings through open application
program interfaces (APIs) and our cross-platform software development kits
(SDKs). We have already partnered with several hardware video conferencing and
peripheral providers and with software providers, including Atlassian and
Dropbox. Our App Marketplace has attracted over 1,000 third-party developers,
which we believe will extend the value and adoption of Zoom. We intend to
continue to grow our partnership ecosystem to drive ubiquity and a better user
experience.

their business day as we are the only service to have mobile start, join,
scheduling and screen sharing.

_Zoom Chat_ , a feature of our Zoom Meetings platform, allows users to send
texts, images, audio files and content instantly across desktop, laptop,
tablet and mobile devices. Organizations use messaging to collaborate in
groups or 1-1 channels, share files and information and stay connected. Chat
allows easy invitation to people outside a users organization, and users can
easily switch from a chat to a video meeting during a conversation. Zoom Chat
can also store content, offering discoverability to users who want to review
their conversations or shared files. **__**

**_Zoom Rooms_**

Zoom Rooms is our software-based conference room system, which enables users
to have frictionless Zoom Meetings in their physical meeting spaces. Running
on third-party off-the-shelf hardware, Zoom Rooms is a cost-effective way to
outfit meeting spaces at scale with video and voice conferencing, wireless
content sharing and calendar integrations. This adaptable platform brings
video to conference, huddle and training rooms, as well as executive offices,
clinics and classrooms. The use of affordable, off-the-shelf hardware means
that companies can outfit many more rooms with video instead of a few key
executive conference rooms.

_Zoom Rooms Scheduling Display_ , running on an iOS or Android tablet outside
the conferencing space, allows users to see upcoming meetings, check in and
schedule spontaneous meetings.

**_Zoom Conference Room Connector_**

The Zoom Conference Room Connector is a gateway for H.323 and SIP devices to
join Zoom meetings. For organizations that use H.323 or SIP conference room
systems from providers such as Polycom and Cisco, Zooms Conference Room
Connector can take these traditional hardware video conferencing systems to
the cloud, allowing users to leverage their existing investments while taking
advantage of our platform. This service may be used permanently, or as a
bridge while an organization transitions from its legacy hardware-based
conference rooms to software-based Zoom Rooms.

**_Zoom Phone_**

Zoom Phone is a cloud phone system available as an add-on that enhances our
communications platform. We support inbound and outbound calling through the
public switched telephone network and integrated traditional telephony
features to enable customers to replace their existing private branch exchange
(PBX) solution and consolidate all of their business communications and
collaboration requirements onto Zoom.

**_Zoom Video Webinars_**

Zoom Video Webinars allows users to conduct large-scale online events such as
town hall meetings, workshops and marketing presentations. Up to 100 panelists
with full video, voice, chat and content sharing are able to communicate to
over 10,000 view-only attendees. Zoom Video Webinars includes features such as
Q&A, reporting, invitations and CRM and marketing automation software
integrations. It also easily integrates with Facebook Live and YouTube,
providing access to large bases of viewers. ** __**

**_Zoom for Developers and Zoom App Marketplace_**

Zoom for Developers allows developers to integrate our video, voice, chat and
content sharing into other applications. On this solution, Zoom, third-party
developers and partners build applications that integrate our platform with
other cloud services. Our customers can also develop private applications that
integrate Zoom into their systems. Our rich toolbox of extensible APIs, cross-
platform SDKs and MobileRTC powered an average of more than 140 million API
engagements per month for the 12 months ended January 31, 2019.

Our App Marketplace brings together these integrations built by Zoom and
third-party developers, making it easy for developers to publish their apps
and for customers to enhance their Zoom experience with new functionalities.
We fully vet apps in our marketplace for security and user experience. Our App
Marketplace features apps and bots with services such as HubSpot, Microsoft
Teams and YouTube.

**Our Technology and Infrastructure**

Our unique technology and infrastructure enable best-in-class reliability,
scalability and performance. We designed our communications platform to be
video-first and cloud-native. Most legacy approaches utilize single multipoint
control units (MCUs) to bridge video and voice participants into an integrated
stream that is broadcast back to the participants. These hardware devices are
shipped with defined processing and memory capacity that are difficult to
scale. In addition, an MCU architecture is similar to other mainframe-like
approaches where stream processing and mixing run on the same machine, which
is resource-intensive and limits scalability.

Our technology was specifically designed from the start to address the most
difficult component of communications: video. Video requires intense computing
resources for encoding, decoding, multiplexing and synchronization, as well as
higher bandwidth and network performance, to a much higher degree than other



86

* * *

##### Table of Contents

forms of communication like voice, chat and content sharing. Our architecture
separates video content processing from the transporting and mixing of
streams. We allocate video content processing to intelligent agents that
reside on client devices and dynamically encode and decode based upon the
performance of client technology, network performance and bandwidth. We
leverage a next-generation multimedia router (MMR) that operates on commodity
hardware and a globally distributed cloud infrastructure to determine the
optimal data centers to host a meeting and an optimal set of paths to connect
the participants.

Our technology and infrastructure have the following key strengths:



  |  |   |

**__****_Architectural separation of content processing from stream routing_**
**.** Client-side processing for encoding and decoding, our MMR for routing
and dynamic optimization of stream traffic enables us to provide reliable
high-quality communications. This architecture means each MMR can support
approximately 1,100 more meeting participants than a standard MCU, which
generally supports up to 80 participants.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**__****_Distributed cloud-native infrastructure from the start_** **.** From
day one, we have invested in a distributed architecture and load balancing to
ensure that end users always get the best possible performance and quality.
Our geographically distributed architecture enables users to connect to the
data center closest to their location. Our distributed architecture also
enables us to provide a more scalable service. Our microservices architecture
allows us to access resources automatically that enable us to seamlessly grow
our capacity. As a result, from a technology perspective, we provide our users
with a reliable video experience from two to thousands of video participants.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**__****_Proactive quality of service application layer at client_** **.** Our
optimization technology is based on proprietary algorithms that detect packet
loss, latency, jitter, CPU utilization and bitrate/bandwidth to optimize the
video, audio and content sharing experience. Depending on the type of device,
our algorithm prioritizes the factors most important for the particular
device, resulting in the best possible user experience.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**__****_Security and disaster recovery_** **.** We offer robust security
capabilities, including end-to-end encryption, secure login, administrative
controls and role-based access controls. Our platform is SOC2 Type II and
TRUSTArc compliant and enables customer HIPAA compliance. We have resilient
disaster recovery capabilities, including active-active disaster recovery for
real-time processes to help ensure that backup active servers are available.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
Our cloud-native infrastructure offers the following key strengths:



  |  |   |

**__****_Private cloud for real-time activities._** We host real-time video
and voice using 13 co-located data centers on our own servers around the
world. We have built a network of private links so that each data center
connects to multiple others. This structure creates redundancies and ensures
reliability and performance.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

**__****_Optimized public cloud usage._** For maximum efficiency, we deploy
public cloud providers (Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure) to host our
web applications and messaging service that do not require real time usage.

**_Customer Case Studies_**

The following are representative examples of how some of our customers have
benefitted from adopting Zoom:

_Chan Zuckerberg Initiative_

_Situation_ : The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is a philanthropic
organization focused on using technology to help solve intractable challenges
such as eradicating disease and reforming the criminal justice system.
Entering 2018 as a rapidly growing organization, CZI struggled with having
high-quality and reliable video conferencing. Meetings with remote
participants often did not start on time as conference rooms were not easy to
use, regularly had technical failures such as dropped calls, and rapid
employee growth led to confusion due to a lack of training on a complicated
system.



88

* * *

##### Table of Contents

_Solution_ : CZI deployed Zoom across the organization, initially for mostly
internal meetings, but rapidly expanded to global internal and external
communications. Meetings begin on time more often as Zoom meetings are easy to
start and do not require complex setup within Zoom Rooms. Employees no longer
need extensive video conferencing training and have experienced increased
reliability with their calls. CZI employees periodically work with
organizations around the world, so Zooms reliability in low-bandwidth
environments helps ensure those meetings can be conducted over video. In
addition to deploying Zoom to employee devices, CZI has adopted a 100% video
conferencing approach within their conference rooms and event spaces, building
out nearly 100 Zoom Rooms of varying sizes and uses.

_Discovery Communications, LLC_

_Situation_ : Discovery Communications, LLC (Discovery) is a global leader in
real life entertainment, with more than 150 worldwide cable TV networks,
including Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, and The Learning Channel (TLC).
Discovery was previously operating with a mix of video conferencing solutions
across desktop, mobile, and conference rooms, which created significant
complexity due to the number of disparate tools and use cases, coupled with
the burden of maintaining on-premises systems. Many of these tools were unable
to properly share video and audio content simultaneously at high bit rates, a
critical task for a media company that needs to collaborate on, review and
edit video content across its global workforce.

_Solution_ : In 2018, Discovery chose Zoom as its communication platform to
unify video communications across desktop, mobile and conference rooms. Zoom
was selected in part for its cloud infrastructure and its support for legacy
hardware with Zoom Conference Room Connector, which allowed Discovery to
transition over time from its legacy solutions to Zoom Rooms. Discovery is now
rolling out Zoom Rooms globally, thereby unifying all video communications
through one cloud platform. Discovery makes extensive use of Zooms video and
audio screen sharing, a feature that allows its employees to share and
collaborate on streaming content, such as television episodes and commercials,
over Zoom. Discovery also makes frequent use of Zooms Microsoft Outlook and
Workplace by Facebook integrations, through which Discoverys employees can
directly broadcast from the Zoom client to Workplace.

_F5 Networks, Inc._

_Situation_ : F5 Networks, Inc. (F5) delivers cloud and application security
services to the worlds largest businesses, service providers, governments,
and consumer brands. With more than 4,500 employees around the globe, F5 found
that its previous collaboration tools struggled to support users across
different regions and devices (especially Mac users). F5s employees were
using four different collaboration providers, creating inefficiencies and
requiring F5s IT to support multiple tools. Additionally, without reliable
VoIP, F5 relied heavily on PSTN audio calls, which resulted in an average of
$65,000 per year in overage charges.

_Solution_ : In May 2018, F5 chose Zoom to replace all four providers it had
been using for communication and collaboration. F5 rolled out Zoom in fewer
than 90 days to the entire company. F5 saw a dramatic increase in its Zoom
usage, with the total number of Zoom meetings increasing by more than seven
times and total hours spent on Zoom increasing by more than 10 times, all
within the first 90 days of adoption. F5s employees were also using Zoom
differently than previous tools. The number of people using video to connect
through virtual face-to-face interactions increased significantly. Zooms
high-quality VoIP reduced the audio overages expense as employees used Zoom
for meeting audio instead of the phone, resulting in significant cost savings.
Within the first month, VoIP was used in more than 70% of Zoom meetings, and
VoIP usage has continued to grow quarter-over-quarter. Zoom has helped support
broader company initiatives, such as an expanded work-from-home policy,
greater international expansion, and virtual company-wide all-hands meetings.
F5s new Seattle headquarters is fully Zoom-enabled with over 190 Zoom Rooms,
including a Zoom-powered executive briefing center, interview rooms, and
training rooms.

_National Australia Bank_

_Situation_ : National Australia Bank (NAB) is Australias largest business
bank, with 33,000 employees serving 9 million customers at more than 900
locations. NAB funds important infrastructure in its communities including
schools, hospitals and roads. In 2018, NAB began looking for a collaboration
technology that would support its modernization efforts and help to drive
cultural transformation at the 160-year-old bank.

_Solution_ : NAB extensively tested a variety of services, simulating, in
particular, low bandwidth environments given its broad local and international
footprint. NAB found that Zoom consistently outperformed other services,
solving the challenges it experienced collaborating across its branch network.
Zoom also met all of NABs requirements, including working across devices and
workspaces, performing well in low bandwidth environments, and suitable to
scale to 33,000+ users effortlessly. Zoom was also selected because of its
ability to integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Teams and Office 365.
Additionally, Zooms ability to support companywide all-hands meetings on
video, allowing NABs CEO to connect face-to-face with the global employee
base, was a key selection factor. Finally, Zoom Rooms have significantly
lowered the cost of building video-enabled conference rooms, allowing NAB to
scale video collaboration spaces even to small remote branches.

_Uber Technologies Inc._

_Situation_ : Uber Technologies Inc. (Uber) is a global company whose mission
is to ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion. Uber has completed
more than 10 billion trips and is committed to building a platform that
enables the safe, efficient movement of people around the world. With over
20,000 employees in hundreds of offices in more than 60 countries, Uber needed
a scalable, robust platform to manage its workforce communications. Uber also
wanted to outfit thousands of huddle and conference rooms in a way that would
not cost tens of thousands of dollars per room. Additionally, given the global
distribution of its workforce, Uber required a communication platform that its
employees could use to communicate and collaborate from anywhere.

_Solution_ : Uber deployed Zoom in 2014 across its organization. Zoom was able
to match Ubers swift growth as it expanded around the world and rapidly grew
its employee base. Uber has added thousands of Zoom licenses each year to
match Ubers growth. Zoom is now woven into the fabric of Ubers culture.
Employees use Zoom to communicate and collaborate with each other from around
the world. Uber has also established over 2,000 Zoom Rooms. Uber averaged over
14 million Zoom meeting minutes a month in 2018 with a Zoom CSAT greater than
95.

_VMware, Inc._

_Situation_ : VMware, Inc. (VMware) is a provider of cloud computing and
platform virtualization software and services with over 21,000 employees and
large engineering offices in Palo Alto and India. VMware employees
historically used a mix of legacy tools to collaborate, causing users to
experience low-quality connections and consistent challenges sharing content
through video communications. VMware wanted to encourage a collaborative
environment through the use of video, which it found to be difficult given the
poor quality and reliability of video services in low bandwidth environments.

_Solution_ : VMware rolled out Zoom across the company starting in December
2017. In January 2019, VMware had over 19,000 Zoom users who hosted over 41
million meeting minutes in January alone. Those meetings were attended by more
than a million participants. In addition to providing Zoom to its employees
for desktop and mobile meetings, VMware deployed Zoom Video Webinars for town
halls and public events. VMware uses a number of Zoom integrations that
further collaboration and business goals, including Slack, Microsoft Teams and
Salesforce Pardot. VMware has achieved significant cost savings by using Zoom
VoIP in place of PSTN. Employees are overwhelmingly happy with Zoom. The
average monthly CSAT for VMware employees using Zoom from December 2017
through November 2018 was 96%, as measured by customer

surveys. Zoom has become more than just a vendor for VMware, as improving
employee experience is a key transformation program for IT. With Zoom
solutions integrated with VMware Workspace ONE, deployment has been flawless
and the one-touch sign-on features have been well-received by users.

**Sales**

Our sales model combines our viral demand generation and our free Zoom Meeting
plan with a sales approach optimized for the size of each customer
opportunity. This approach allows us to cost-effectively drive strong lead
generation, upgrade free users to paid users and expand within organizations
of all sizes and verticals. We leverage this demand through an integrated set
of routes-to-market that include direct sales representatives, online channel,
resellers and strategic partners. Our direct sales force includes our field
sales representatives as well as our inside sales team, and it is organized by
customer employee count and vertical. Our channel team coordinates the
activities of resellers and strategic partners to build a strong ecosystem
that broadens our reach. Our online channel supports high-volume, high-
velocity, self-service sales.

**Marketing**

Our marketing teams primary objective is to create preference for our brand
by leveraging our viral growth, building awareness and engaging our users in
person. Our team leverages our viral demand model to attract more paying users
through orchestrated customer marketing programs, which reduces customer
acquisition costs. We complement our viral growth with targeted online and out
of home advertising. We use a variety of weighted metrics to determine our
target geographic markets. We work with analysts and customers to provide
third-party validation of our platform. We also participated in over 180
marketing and customer events around the world in 2018 and connect with and
celebrate our users at Zoomtopia, our annual user conference.

**Research and Development**

We drive our business with constant innovation. Our ability to lead our market
depends on our rapid introduction of new applications, technologies, features
and functionality. We respond to customer needs with action to drive positive
user experiences. Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of video
communication and collaboration technologies and release on average over 200
new and enhanced features a year. We strive to deliver the best experience to
our users by dedicating approximately 20% of engineering capacity to
developing on-demand, customer-requested features that would be valuable
across our customer base. We have research and development presence in both
the United States and China, which we believe is a strategic advantage for us,
allowing us to invest more in increasing our product capabilities in an
efficient manner.

**Our Competition**

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. A significant number
of companies have developed or are developing products and services that
currently, or in the future may, compete with some or all of our offerings.
Many of these services do not offer complete solutions  often they provide a
feature comparable to a component of our platform (e.g., only conference
rooms, only chat, only telephony). We primarily face competition from legacy
web-based meeting services providers, including Webex and Skype for Business,
bundled productivity solutions providers with basic video functionality,
including Google, and point solutions providers, including LogMeIn. Our
introduction of Zoom Phone may lead to competition with legacy PBX providers.

We believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors:

**Intellectual Property**

Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek
protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. To establish and
protect our proprietary rights, we rely upon a combination of patent,
copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and contractual restrictions such
as confidentiality agreements, licenses and intellectual property assignment
agreements. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors,
consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and
proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary
information. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited
protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged,
invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Furthermore, the laws
of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as
the laws of the United States, and we therefore may be unable to protect our
proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions. Moreover, our platform
incorporates software components licensed to the general public under open
source software licenses. We obtain many components from software developed
and released by contributors to independent open source components of our
platform. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy,
modify and redistribute our platform. As a result, open source development and
licensing practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets.

We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and
patentability of new intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our
domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain
locations outside the United States. To protect our brand, we file trademark
registrations in some jurisdictions.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising from
the normal course of business activities. We are not presently a party to any
litigation the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us,
would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Defending such
proceedings is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and
employees. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings in the
course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final
outcomes will be obtained.

**Our Facilities**

Our corporate headquarters is located in San Jose, California, where we lease
approximately 66,000 square feet of commercial space pursuant to operating
leases that expire in the year ending January 31, 2030. In addition, we
maintain additional offices in the United States and internationally in
Australia, China and the United Kingdom. We believe that our facilities are
suitable to meet our current needs.

**Our Employees**

As of January 31, 2019, we had 1,702 full-time employees. Of these employees,
1,012 are in the United States and 690 are in our international locations.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by
collective bargaining agreements, and we have not experienced any work
stoppages.

**Composition of Our Board of Directors**

Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our board of
directors. We currently have eight directors. Our current directors will
continue to serve as directors until their resignation, removal or successor
is duly elected. Pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws and amended and
restated certificate of incorporation as in effect prior to the completion of
this offering and a voting agreement, Messrs. Scheinman and Yuan were elected
to serve as members of our board of directors by the holders of our common
stock, Messrs. Eschenbach, Subotovsky and Swanson were elected to serve as
members of our board of directors by the holders of our convertible preferred
stock, and Messrs. Chadwick and Gassner and Ms. Hammonds were elected to serve
as members of our board of directors by the holders of a majority of our
capital stock, voting together. The provisions of our amended and restated
bylaws, amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and the voting
agreement by which the directors are currently elected will terminate in
connection with this offering, and there will be no contractual obligations
regarding the election of our directors upon completion of this offering.

Our board of directors may establish the authorized number of directors from
time to time by resolution. In accordance with our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation that will be in effect upon the completion of
this offering, immediately after this offering, our board of directors will be
divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. At each annual
general meeting of stockholders, the successors to directors whose terms then
expire will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification
until the third annual meeting following election. Our directors will be
divided among the three classes as follows:



  |  |   |

the Class I directors will be Messrs. Gassner and Yuan, and their terms will
expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders following this offering;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

the Class II directors will be Messrs. Chadwick and Scheinman and Ms.
Hammonds, and their terms will expire at our second annual meeting of
stockholders following this offering; and  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

the Class III directors will be Messrs. Eschenbach, Subotovsky and Swanson,
and their terms will expire at our third annual meeting of stockholders
following this offering.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
We expect that any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the
number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as
nearly as possible, each class will consist of one third of the directors. The
division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered three-
year terms may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change in
control.

**Director Independence**

Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each
director. Based on information provided by each director concerning his or her
background, employment and affiliations, our board of directors has determined
that Ms. Hammonds and Messrs. Chadwick, Eschenbach, Gassner, Scheinman,
Subotovsky and Swanson do not have relationships that would interfere with the
exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a
director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is
defined under the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. In making
these determinations, our board of directors considered the current and prior
relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all
other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in
determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our
shares held by each non-employee director and the transactions described in
the section titled Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.

**Lead Independent Director**

Effective as of the date the registration statement of which this prospectus
forms a part is declared effective by the SEC, our corporate governance
guidelines will provide that in the event that the chairman of the board of
directors is not an independent director, our independent directors will
designate one of the independent directors to serve as lead independent
director, and if the chairman of the board of directors is an independent
director, our board of directors may determine whether it is appropriate to
appoint a lead independent director. The corporate governance guidelines will
provide that if our board of directors elects a lead independent director,
currently Mr. Scheinman, such lead independent director will preside over
meetings of our independent directors, coordinate activities of the
independent directors, oversee, with our nominating and corporate governance
committee, the self-evaluation of our board of directors, including committees
of our board of directors, and preside over any portions of meetings of our
board of directors at which the performance of our board of directors is
presented or discussed, be available for consultation and director
communication with stockholders as deemed appropriate, and perform such
additional duties as our board of directors may otherwise determine and
delegate.

**Committees of Our Board of Directors**

Our board of directors has established an audit committee, a compensation
committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. The composition
and responsibilities of each of the committees of our board of directors are
described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or

may establish other committees as it deems necessary or appropriate from time
to time.

audit committee is Mr. Chadwick. Our board of directors has determined that
Mr. Chadwick is an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of
SEC regulations. Each member of our audit committee can read and understand
fundamental financial statements in accordance with applicable requirements.
In arriving at these determinations, our board of directors has examined each
audit committee members scope of experience and the nature of his employment.

The primary purpose of the audit committee is to discharge the
responsibilities of our board of directors with respect to our corporate
accounting and financial reporting processes, systems of internal control and

---|---  
  
**Annual Performance-Based Bonus Opportunity**

In addition to base salaries, our executive officers other than Mr. Yuan are
eligible to receive performance-based cash bonuses, which are designed to
provide appropriate incentives to our executives to achieve defined
performance goals and to reward our executives for individual achievement
towards these goals. The performance-based bonus each executive officer is
eligible to receive is generally based on the extent to which we achieve the
corporate goals that our board or compensation committee establishes and is
paid quarterly.

For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, Ms. Pelosi was eligible to receive
a bonus at an annual target of approximately 20% of her fiscal base salary,
Ms. Bawa was eligible to receive a bonus at an annual target of 35% of her
base salary and Mr. Holmes was eligible to receive a bonus at an annual target
of approximately 100% of his base salary. Our corporate performance objectives
for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 related to achievement of monthly
recurring revenue targets and, with respect to Mr. Holmes, sales targets under
our sales commission program. Ms. Pelosi, Ms. Bawa and Mr. Holmes earned
bonuses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 performance based on our
achievement of the relevant performance targets for each executive. Ms. Bawas
earned bonus amount was prorated for the period of time she was employed
during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019. All bonuses for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2019 were paid in cash. ****

**Equity-Based Incentive Awards**

Prior to this offering, we have granted stock options to each of our named
executive officers pursuant to the 2011 Plan, the terms of which are described
below under Equity Incentive Plans. All options are granted with a per
share exercise price equal to no less than the fair market value of a share of
our common stock on the date of the grant of such award.

In September 2018, our compensation committee granted options to purchase
500,000 shares to Mr. Yuan, 450,000 shares to Ms. Pelosi, 360,000 shares to
Ms. Bawa and 300,000 shares to Mr. Holmes. Each of the options have an
exercise price per share of $3.77, except that 132,585 shares of Mr. Yuans
option have an exercise price per share of $4.15 in order to comply with tax
rules governing options intended to be incentive stock options. The shares
subject to each of the September 2018 options vest in 48 equal monthly
installments measured from the grant date, subject to the executives
continuous service with us as of each such vesting date. Ms. Bawas option
grant permits early exercise, whereby Ms. Bawa may purchase shares prior to
vesting, subject to our right to repurchase such shares, lapsing over time in
accordance with the vesting schedule of the stock option.

##### Table of Contents

Ms. Bawa exercised her option in full in September 2018. In October 2018, our
compensation committee amended Mr. Yuans September 2018 option (to the extent
of 367,415 shares thereunder that did not pertain to the incentive stock
option portion of his grant) to also permit early exercise, whereby Mr. Yuan
could purchase shares prior to vesting, subject to our right to repurchase
such shares, lapsing over time in accordance with the vesting schedule of the
stock option.

Each of our named executive officers option grants are additionally subject
to potential vesting acceleration as described below under Agreements with
our Named Executive Officers.

**Agreements with Our Named Executive Officers**

_Eric S. Yuan._ In December 2018, we entered into a confirmatory offer letter

Head of Worldwide Sales or one of our executive officers, and has transitioned
to a corporate strategy role with us.

**Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control**

Regardless of the manner in which a named executive officers service
terminates, each named executive officer is entitled to receive amounts earned
during his or her term of service, including unpaid salary and unused
vacation.

Each of our named executive officers is eligible for severance benefits in the
form of a payment equal to six months of base salary, accelerated vesting of
all outstanding equity awards and payment of up to six months of COBRA
premiums, upon an involuntary termination within the 12 months following a
change in control (as



103

defined in the confirmatory offer letter), pursuant to the confirmatory offer
letters described above under Agreements with Our Named Executive Officers.
An involuntary termination for purposes of the severance benefits generally
means a termination by us other than for death, disability or cause (as
defined in the confirmatory offer letter) or a resignation for good reason (as
defined in the confirmatory offer letter). In addition, each of our named
executive officers stock options are subject to the terms of the 2011 Plan

**Other Compensation and Benefits**

All of our current named executive officers are eligible to participate in our
employee benefit plans, including our medical, dental, vision, life,
disability and accidental death and dismemberment insurance plans, in each
case on the same basis as all of our other employees. We pay the premiums for
the life, disability and accidental death and dismemberment insurance for all
of our employees, including our named executive officers. We generally do not
provide perquisites or personal benefits to our named executive officers.

We maintain a 401(k) plan that provides eligible U.S. employees with an
opportunity to save for retirement on a tax advantaged basis. Eligible
employees are able to defer eligible compensation up to certain Code limits,
which are updated annually. We have the ability to make matching and
discretionary contributions to the 401(k) plan. Currently, we do not make
matching contributions or discretionary contributions to the 401(k) plan. The
401(k) plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, with
the related trust intended to be tax exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code.
As a tax-qualified retirement plan, contributions to the 401(k) plan are
deductible by us when made and contributions and earnings on those amounts are
not generally taxable to the employees until withdrawn or distributed from the
401(k) plan.

Our named executive officers did not participate in, or earn any benefits
under, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan sponsored by us during the
fiscal year ended January 31, 2019. Our board of directors may elect to
provide our officers and other employees with nonqualified defined
contribution or other nonqualified deferred compensation benefits in the
future if it determines that doing so is in our best interests.

Our named executive officers did not participate in, or otherwise receive any
benefits under, any pension or retirement plan sponsored by us during the
fiscal year ended January 31, 2019.

**Clawback Policy**

As a public company, if we are required to restate our financial results due
to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under
the federal securities laws as a result of misconduct, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer may be legally required to reimburse us
for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation they
receive in accordance with the provisions of section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

Additionally, we voluntarily adopted an incentive compensation recoupment, or
clawback, policy that will become effective on the date of the underwriting
agreement related to this offering, ahead of final guidance by the SEC
regarding the claw back rules that will be required under the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Under our clawback policy, if an
officers misconduct contributed to our having to prepare an accounting
restatement to correct an error material to our previously issued financial
statements, we may seek to recover incentive compensation (which may include
cash bonus or incentive compensation, certain outstanding equity awards or
severance or change in control compensation) that was granted, vested or paid



105

* * *

##### Table of Contents

during the 12 month period preceding the restatement obligation as noted
above. Our board of directors has the authority and discretion to determine
whether an event covered by our clawback policy has occurred and, depending on
the facts and circumstances, may (but need not) require full or partial
forfeiture and/or prepayment of the incentive compensation described above.
Additionally, we intend to comply with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act and will modify our clawback policy to the extent
required by law as soon as, and to the extent that, the requirements of such
clawbacks are finalized by the SEC.

**Equity Plans**

**_Fourth Amended and Restated 2011 Global Share Plan_**

Our board of directors adopted our 2011 Plan in April 2011, and our
stockholders approved the 2011 Plan in June 2011. The 2011 Plan has been
periodically amended, most recently in September 2017. As of January 31, 2019,
there were 1,848,100 shares of Class B common stock remaining available for
the future grant of stock awards under our 2011 Plan. As of January 31, 2019,
stock options covering 35,064,465 shares of our Class B common stock were
outstanding and restricted shares covering 1,441,638 shares of Class B common
stock were outstanding and subject to vesting and our repurchase right under
the 2011 Plan. We expect that any shares of Class B common stock remaining
available for issuance under the 2011 Plan at the time of this offering will
become available for issuance for a corresponding number of shares of our
Class A common stock under the 2019 Plan.

_Stock Awards_. Our 2011 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock
options (ISOs) within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code
(Code) to our employees or certain of our subsidiary companies, and for the
grant of nonstatutory stock options (NSOs) and restricted shares to such
employees, our directors and to consultants engaged by us or any of our
subsidiary companies. The 2011 Plan further provides for the grant of options
and restricted shares to service providers who are not U.S. persons and
certain types of trusts for the benefit of service providers, subject to
certain restrictions.

_Authorized Shares_. Subject to certain capitalization adjustments, the
aggregate number of shares of Class B common stock that may be issued pursuant
to stock awards under the 2011 Plan will not exceed 71,240,000 shares.

Shares subject to stock awards granted under our 2011 Plan that expire, become
unexercisable or are cancelled, forfeited to or repurchased by us due to the
failure to vest, or otherwise terminated without having been exercised or
settled in full, or are surrendered pursuant to an exchange program (as
described below) in accordance with the 2011 Plan, shall revert to and again
become available for issuance under the 2011 Plan (unless the 2011 Plan has
terminated). This includes shares that are reacquired pursuant to any
forfeiture provision, right of repurchase or redemption or shares that are
used to satisfy the exercise or purchase price for the award or any tax
withholding obligations related to an award.

_Plan Administration_. Our board of directors administers and interprets the
provisions of the 2011 Plan. The board of directors may delegate its authority
to a committee of the board and has delegated authority to the compensation
committee of the board, referred to as the plan administrator. The plan
administrator may additionally delegate limited authority to specified
officers to execute any instrument required to effect an award previously
granted by the plan administrator. Under our 2011 Plan, the plan administrator
has the authority to, among other things, determine award recipients, the
numbers and types of stock awards to be granted, the applicable fair market
value and the provisions of each stock award, including the period of their
exercisability and the vesting schedule applicable to a stock award, construe
and interpret the 2011 Plan and awards granted thereunder, prescribe, amend
and rescind rules and regulations for the administration of the 2011 Plan, and
accelerate the vesting of awards.

Under the 2011 Plan, the plan administrator also has the authority, without
stockholder consent, to institute and determine the terms of an exchange
program under which (i) outstanding awards are surrendered or



106

* * *

##### Table of Contents

cancelled in exchange for awards of the same type (which may have higher or
lower exercise or purchase prices and different terms), awards of a different
type, and/or cash, (ii) participants would have the opportunity to transfer
any outstanding awards to a financial institution or other person or entity
selected by the plan administrator and/or (iii) the exercise or purchase price
of an outstanding award is reduced or increased.

_Stock Options_. ISOs and NSOs are granted under share option agreements and
option rules adopted by the plan administrator. The plan administrator
determines the exercise price for stock options, within the terms and
conditions of the 2011 Plan, provided that the exercise price of a stock
option generally will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our
common stock on the date of grant (or 110% of the fair market value for 10%
stockholders as required by the Code). Options granted under the 2011 Plan
vest at the rate specified in the share option agreements and option rules as
determined by the plan administrator.

The plan administrator determines the term of stock options granted under the
2011 Plan, up to a maximum of 10 years (or five years for 10% stockholders as
required by the Code). If an optionholders service relationship with us or
any of our affiliates ceases for any reason other than disability or death,
the optionholder may generally exercise any vested options for a period of up
to 30 days following the cessation of service, or such other period of time
set forth in the share option agreement. If an optionholders service
relationship with us or any of our affiliates ceases due to death, the
executors or administrators of the optionholders estate or any person who has
acquired the option from the optionholder by beneficiary designation, bequest
or inheritance may generally exercise any vested options for a period of up to
six months following the date of death, or such other period of time set forth
in the share option agreement. If an optionholders service relationship with
us or any of our affiliates ceases due to disability, the optionholder may
generally exercise any vested options for a period of up to six months
following the cessation of service, or such other period of time set forth in
the share option agreement. In no event may an option be exercised beyond the
expiration of its term.

The exercise price for shares issued under the 2011 Plan are generally payable
in cash or cash equivalents or other forms of consideration determined by the
plan administrator, including but not limited to a broker-assisted cashless
exercise or a net exercise.

Unless the plan administrator provides otherwise, options generally are not
transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or (except
for ISOs) pursuant to a domestic relations order.

_Restricted Shares_. Restricted shares may be awarded in consideration for
cash or cash equivalents or another form of consideration, including past
services, as determined by our plan administrator. Restricted shares may also
be issued upon an optionholders exercise of an unvested option, or an early
exercise. The plan administrator determines the terms and conditions of
restricted shares, including vesting and forfeiture terms. If a participants
service relationship with us ends for any reason, we may receive any or all of
the shares of Class B common stock held by the participant that have not
vested as of the date the participant terminates service with us through a
forfeiture condition or a repurchase right. Restricted shares acquired upon
early exercise of a stock option are generally subject to our right to
repurchase such shares upon the holders termination of service with us for
any reason, at the lesser of the price paid for such shares or the then-
current fair market value.

_Changes to Capital Structure_. In the event of any dividend or other
distribution, recapitalization, share split, reverse share split,
reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination,
repurchase or exchange of shares or other change in our corporate structure
affecting our shares, the plan administrator will adjust the number and class
of shares that may be delivered under the 2011 Plan and/or the number, class
and price of shares covered by each outstanding award.

_Corporate Transactions_. In the event of a merger or a change in control,
each outstanding award will be treated as the plan administrator determines,
which may include, without limitation, a determination that:



  |  |   |

awards will be assumed or substituted by the acquiring or succeeding
corporation with appropriate adjustments;  
  
---|---|---|---

  |  |   |

upon written notice to the participant, the participants awards will
terminate upon or immediately prior to the consummation of such merger or
change in control;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

outstanding awards will vest and become exercisable, realizable or payable, or
restrictions applicable to an award will lapse, in whole or in part prior to
or upon consummation of such merger or change in control and, to the extent
the plan administrator determines, terminate upon or immediately prior to the
effectiveness of such merger or change in control;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

an award will terminate in exchange for an amount of cash and/or property, if
any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of
such award or realization of the participants rights as of the date of the
occurrence of the transaction or an award will be replaced with other rights
or property selected by the plan administrator in its sole discretion; or  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

any combination of the foregoing.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
The plan administrator is not obligated to treat all awards similarly.

In the event that the successor corporation in a merger or change in control
does not assume or substitute an award, the award will fully vest and become
exercisable and with respect to awards with performance-based vesting, all
performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at 100% of
target levels and all other terms and conditions met. If the award is an
option, it will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the plan
administrator and will terminate upon the expiration of such period.

In addition to the above, the plan administrator may provide, in an award
agreement or in any other written agreement between the participant and the
Company, for accelerated vesting and exercisability in the event of a change
in control or similar transaction.

Under the 2011 Plan, a change in control is generally defined as the
occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a change in our ownership that
occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a
group, acquires ownership of our share capital that, together with the share
capital held by such person, constitutes more than 50% of our stockholders
total voting power, except as a result of a private financing approved by the
board of directors; (ii) if we have a class of securities registered pursuant
to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, a change in the effective control of the
Company that occurs on the date that a majority of our directors on the board
of directors are replaced during any 12 month period by directors whose
appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the
board of directors prior to the date of the appointment or election or (iii) a
change in the ownership of a substantial portion of our assets that occurs on
the date that any person acquires assets from us that have a total gross fair
market value equal to or more than 50% of the total gross fair market value of
all of our assets immediately prior to such acquisition.

_Plan Amendment or Termination_. The plan administrator may at any time amend,
alter, suspend or terminate the 2011 Plan. Certain amendments, alterations, or
the suspension or discontinuance of the 2011 Plan may require the written
consent of holders of outstanding awards. Certain material amendments also
require the approval of our stockholders. Unless sooner terminated, the 2011
Plan terminates in September 2027.

**_2019 Equity Incentive Plan_**

Our board of directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, our 2019 Plan
in April 2019. Our 2019 Plan is a successor to and continuation of our 2011
Plan. Our 2019 Plan will become effective on the date of the underwriting
agreement related to this offering. The 2019 Plan came into existence upon its
adoption by our board of directors, but no grants will be made under the 2019
Plan prior to its effectiveness. Once the 2019 Plan is effective, no further
grants will be made under the 2011 Plan.

_Awards_. Our 2019 Plan provides for the grant of ISOs to employees, including
employees of any parent or subsidiary, and for the grant of NSOs, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit



108

##### Table of Contents

awards, performance awards and other forms of awards to employees, directors
and consultants, including employees and consultants of our affiliates.

_Authorized Shares_. Initially, the maximum number of shares of our Class A
common stock that may be issued under our 2019 Plan after it becomes effective
will not exceed 58,300,889 shares of our Class A common stock, which is the
sum of (1) 34,000,000 new shares, plus (2) an additional number of shares not
to exceed 24,300,889, consisting of (A) shares that remain available for the
issuance of awards under our 2011 Plan as of immediately prior to the time our
2019 Plan becomes effective and (B) shares of Class B common stock subject to
outstanding stock options or other stock awards granted under our 2011 Plan
that, on or after the 2019 Plan becomes effective, terminate or expire prior
to exercise or settlement; are not issued because the award is settled in
cash; are forfeited because of the failure to vest; or are reacquired or
withheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding obligation or the
purchase or exercise price, if any, as such shares become available from time
to time. In addition, the number of shares of our Class A common stock
reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan will automatically increase on
February 1 of each calendar year, starting on February 1, 2020 through
February 1, 2029, in an amount equal to (i) 5% of the total number of shares
of our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on January 31 of
the fiscal year before the date of each automatic increase, or (ii) a lesser
number of shares determined by our board of directors prior to the applicable
February 1st. The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock that
may be issued on the exercise of ISOs under our 2019 Plan is 174,902,667
shares.

Shares subject to stock awards granted under our 2019 Plan that expire or
terminate without being exercised in full or that are paid out in cash rather
than in shares do not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under
our 2019 Plan. Shares withheld under a stock award to satisfy the exercise,
strike or purchase price of a stock award or to satisfy a tax withholding
obligation do not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under our
2019 Plan. If any shares of Class A common stock issued pursuant to a stock
award are forfeited back to or repurchased or reacquired by us for any reason,
the shares that are forfeited or repurchased or reacquired will revert to and
again become available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. Any shares previously
issued which are reacquired in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations or
as consideration for the exercise or purchase price of a stock award will
again become available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.

_Plan Administration_. Our board of directors, or a duly authorized committee
of our board of directors, will administer our 2019 Plan and is referred to as
the plan administrator herein. Our board of directors may also delegate to
one or more of our officers the authority to (1) designate employees (other
than officers) to receive specified stock awards and (2) determine the number
of shares subject to such stock awards. Under our 2019 Plan, our board of
directors has the authority to determine award recipients, grant dates, the
numbers and types of stock awards to be granted, the applicable fair market
value, and the provisions of each stock award, including the period of
exercisability and the vesting schedule applicable to a stock award.

Under the 2019 Plan, the board of directors also generally has the authority
to effect, with the consent of any materially adversely affected participant,
(A) the reduction of the exercise, purchase, or strike price of any
outstanding award; (B) the cancellation of any outstanding award and the grant
in substitution therefore of other awards, cash, or other consideration; or
(C) any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted
accounting principles.

_Stock Options_. ISOs and NSOs are granted under stock option agreements
adopted by the plan administrator. The plan administrator determines the
exercise price for stock options, within the terms and conditions of the 2019
Plan, provided that the exercise price of a stock option generally cannot be
less than 100% of the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the
date of grant. Options granted under the 2019 Plan vest at the rate specified
in the stock option agreement as determined by the plan administrator.

The plan administrator determines the term of stock options granted under the
2019 Plan, up to a maximum of 10 years. Unless the terms of an optionholders
stock option agreement provide otherwise, if an optionholders



109

* * *

##### Table of Contents

service relationship with us or any of our affiliates ceases for any reason
other than disability, death, or cause, the optionholder may generally
exercise any vested options for a period of three months following the
cessation of service. This period may be extended in the event that exercise
of the option is prohibited by applicable securities laws. If an
optionholders service relationship with us or any of our affiliates ceases
due to death, or an optionholder dies within a certain period following
cessation of service, the optionholder or a beneficiary may generally exercise
any vested options for a period of 18 months following the date of death. If
an optionholders service relationship with us or any of our affiliates ceases
due to disability, the optionholder may generally exercise any vested options
for a period of 12 months following the cessation of service. In the event of
a termination for cause, options generally terminate upon the termination
date. In no event may an option be exercised beyond the expiration of its
term.

Acceptable consideration for the purchase of Class A common stock issued upon
the exercise of a stock option will be determined by the plan administrator
and may include (1) cash, check, bank draft or money order, (2) a broker-
assisted cashless exercise, (3) the tender of shares of our common stock
previously owned by the optionholder, (4) a net exercise of the option if it
is an NSO, or (5) other legal consideration approved by the plan
administrator.

Unless the plan administrator provides otherwise, options generally are not
transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Subject
to approval of the plan administrator or a duly authorized officer, an option
may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order, official marital
settlement agreement, or other divorce or separation instrument.

_Tax Limitations on ISOs_. The aggregate fair market value, determined at the
time of grant, of our Class A common stock with respect to ISOs that are
exercisable for the first time by an award holder during any calendar year
under all of our stock plans may not exceed $100,000. Options or portions
thereof that exceed such limit will generally be treated as NSOs. No ISO may
be granted to any person who, at the time of the grant, owns or is deemed to
own stock possessing more than 10% of our total combined voting power or that
of any of our affiliates unless (1) the option exercise price is at least 110%
of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option on the date of
grant, and (2) the term of the ISO does not exceed five years from the date of
grant.

_Restricted Stock Unit Awards_. Restricted stock unit awards are granted under
restricted stock unit award agreements adopted by the plan administrator.
Restricted stock unit awards may be granted in consideration for any form of
legal consideration that may be acceptable to our board of directors and
permissible under applicable law. A restricted stock unit award may be settled
by cash, delivery of stock, a combination of cash and stock as deemed
appropriate by the plan administrator, or in any other form of consideration
set forth in the restricted stock unit award agreement. Additionally, dividend
equivalents may be credited in respect of shares covered by a restricted stock
unit award. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement,
restricted stock unit awards that have not vested will be forfeited once the
participants continuous service ends for any reason.

_Restricted Stock Awards_. Restricted stock awards are granted under
restricted stock award agreements adopted by the plan administrator. A
restricted stock award may be awarded in consideration for cash, check, bank
draft or money order, past or future services to us, or any other form of
legal consideration that may be acceptable to our board of directors and
permissible under applicable law. The plan administrator determines the terms
and conditions of restricted stock awards, including vesting and forfeiture
terms. If a participants service relationship with us ends for any reason, we
may receive any or all of the shares of Class A common stock held by the
participant that have not vested as of the date the participant terminates
service with us through a forfeiture condition or a repurchase right.

_Stock Appreciation Rights_. Stock appreciation rights are granted under stock
appreciation right agreements adopted by the plan administrator. The plan
administrator determines the purchase price or strike price for a stock
appreciation right, which generally cannot be less than 100% of the fair
market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. A stock
appreciation right granted under the 2019 Plan vests at the rate specified in
the



110

* * *

##### Table of Contents

stock appreciation right agreement as determined by the plan administrator.
Stock appreciation rights may be settled in cash or shares of Class A common
stock.

The plan administrator determines the term of stock appreciation rights
granted under the 2019 Plan, up to a maximum of 10 years. If a participants
service relationship with us or any of our affiliates ceases for any reason
other than cause, disability, or death, the participant may generally exercise
any vested stock appreciation right for a period of three months following the
cessation of service. This period may be further extended in the event that
exercise of the stock appreciation right following such a termination of
service is prohibited by applicable securities laws. If a participants
service relationship with us, or any of our affiliates, ceases due to
disability or death, or a participant dies within a certain period following
cessation of service, the participant or a beneficiary may generally exercise
any vested stock appreciation right for a period of 12 months in the event of
disability and 18 months in the event of death. In the event of a termination
for cause, stock appreciation rights generally terminate immediately upon the
occurrence of the event giving rise to the termination of the individual for
cause. In no event may a stock appreciation right be exercised beyond the
expiration of its term.

_Performance Awards_. The 2019 Plan permits the grant of performance awards
that may be settled in stock, cash or other property. Performance awards may
be structured so that the stock or cash will be issued or paid only following
the achievement of certain pre-established performance goals during a
designated performance period. Performance awards that are settled in cash or
other property are not required to be valued in whole or in part by reference
to, or otherwise based on, the Class A common stock.

The performance goals may be based any measure of performance selected by the
board of directors. The performance goals may be based on company-wide
performance or performance of one or more business units, divisions,
affiliates, or business segments, and may be either absolute or relative to
the performance of one or more comparable companies or the performance of one
or more relevant indices. Unless specified otherwise by the board of directors
at the time the performance award is granted, the board will appropriately
make adjustments in the method of calculating the attainment of performance
goals as follows: (i) to exclude restructuring and/or other nonrecurring
charges; (ii) to exclude exchange rate effects; (iii) to exclude the effects
of changes to generally accepted accounting principles; (iv) to exclude the
effects of any statutory adjustments to corporate tax rates; (v) to exclude
the effects of items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently as
determined under generally accepted accounting principles; (vi) to exclude the
dilutive effects of acquisitions or joint ventures; (vii) to assume that any
portion of our business which is divested achieved performance objectives at
targeted levels during the balance of a performance period following such
divestiture; (viii) to exclude the effect of any change in the outstanding
shares of our Class A common stock by reason of any stock dividend or split,
stock repurchase, reorganization, recapitalization, merger, consolidation,
spin-off, combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change,
or any distributions to common stockholders other than regular cash dividends;
(ix) to exclude the effects of stock based compensation and the award of
bonuses under our bonus plans; (x) to exclude costs incurred in connection
with potential acquisitions or divestitures that are required to be expensed
under generally accepted accounting principles; and (xi) to exclude the
goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that are required to be
recorded under generally accepted accounting principles.

_Other Stock Awards_. The plan administrator may grant other awards based in
whole or in part by reference to our Class A common stock. The plan
administrator will set the number of shares under the stock award (or cash
equivalent) and all other terms and conditions of such awards.

_Non-Employee Director Compensation Limit. _The aggregate value of all
compensation granted or paid to any Non-Employee Director with respect to any
calendar year, including awards granted and cash fees paid by the Company to
such Non-Employee Director, will not exceed $750,000 in total value.

_Changes to Capital Structure_. In the event there is a specified type of
change in our capital structure, such as a stock split, reverse stock split,
or recapitalization, appropriate adjustments will be made to (1) the class and
maximum number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan, (2) the
class and maximum number of



111

* * *

##### Table of Contents

shares by which the share reserve may increase automatically each year, (3)
the class and maximum number of shares that may be issued on the exercise of
ISOs, and (4) the class and number of shares and exercise price, strike price,
or purchase price, if applicable, of all outstanding stock awards.

_Corporate Transactions_. The following applies to stock awards under the 2019
Plan in the event of a corporate transaction (as defined in the 2019 Plan),
unless otherwise provided in a participants stock award agreement or other
written agreement with us or one of our affiliates or unless otherwise
expressly provided by the plan administrator at the time of grant.

In the event of a corporate transaction, any stock awards outstanding under
the 2019 Plan may be assumed, continued or substituted for by any surviving or
acquiring corporation (or its parent company), and any reacquisition or
repurchase rights held by us with respect to the stock award may be assigned
to the successor (or its parent company). If the surviving or acquiring
corporation (or its parent company) does not assume, continue or substitute
for such stock awards, then (i) with respect to any such stock awards that are
held by participants whose continuous service has not terminated prior to the
effective time of the corporate transaction, or current participants, the
vesting (and exercisability, if applicable) of such stock awards will be
accelerated in full to a date prior to the effective time of the corporate
transaction (contingent upon the effectiveness of the corporate transaction),
and such stock awards will terminate if not exercised (if applicable) at or
prior to the effective time of the corporate transaction, and any
reacquisition or repurchase rights held by us with respect to such stock
awards will lapse (contingent upon the effectiveness of the corporate
transaction), and (ii) any such stock awards that are held by persons other
than current participants will terminate if not exercised (if applicable)
prior to the effective time of the corporate transaction, except that any
reacquisition or repurchase rights held by us with respect to such stock
awards will not terminate and may continue to be exercised notwithstanding the
corporate transaction.

In the event a stock award will terminate if not exercised prior to the
effective time of a corporate transaction, the plan administrator may provide,
in its sole discretion, that the holder of such stock award may not exercise
such stock award but instead will receive a payment equal in value to the
excess (if any) of (i) the per share amount payable to holders of Class A
common stock in connection with the corporate transaction, over (ii) any per
share exercise price payable by such holder provided in the stock award, if
applicable. In addition, any escrow, holdback, earn out or similar provisions
in the definitive agreement for the corporate transaction may apply to such
payment to the same extent and in the same manner as such provisions apply to
the holders of Class A common stock.

Under the 2019 Plan, a corporate transaction is generally the consummation of:
(1) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, (2) the sale or
disposition of more than 50% of our outstanding securities, (3) a merger or
consolidation where we do not survive the transaction, or (4) a merger or
consolidation where we do survive the transaction but the shares of our Class
A common stock outstanding immediately before such transaction are converted
or exchanged into other property by virtue of the transaction.

_Change in Control_. Awards granted under the 2019 Plan may be subject to
acceleration of vesting and exercisability upon or after a change in control
as may be provided in the applicable stock award agreement or in any other
written agreement between us or any affiliate and the participant, but in the
absence of such provision, no such acceleration will automatically occur.
Under the 2019 Plan, a change in control is generally (1) the acquisition by
any person or company of more than 50% of the combined voting power of our
then outstanding stock, (2) a merger, consolidation or similar transaction in
which our stockholders immediately before the transaction do not own, directly
or indirectly, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the surviving
entity (or the parent of the surviving entity) in substantially the same
proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such transaction, (3)
stockholder approval of a complete dissolution or liquidation, (4) a sale,
lease, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of
our assets other than to an entity more than 50% of the combined voting power
of which is owned by our stockholders in substantially the same proportions as
their ownership of our outstanding voting securities immediately prior to such
transaction, or (5) when a majority

of our board of directors becomes comprised of individuals who were not
serving on our board of directors on the date of the underwriting agreement
related to this offering, or the incumbent board, or whose nomination,
appointment, or election was not approved by a majority of the incumbent board
still in office.

_Plan Amendment or Termination_. Our board of directors has the authority to
amend, suspend, or terminate our 2019 Plan, provided that such action does not
materially impair the existing rights of any participant without such
participants written consent. Certain material amendments also require the
approval of our stockholders. No ISOs may be granted after the tenth
anniversary of the date our board of directors adopts our 2019 Plan. No stock
awards may be granted under our 2019 Plan while it is suspended or after it is
terminated.

**_2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan_**

Our board of directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, our ESPP in
April 2019. The ESPP will become effective immediately prior to and contingent
upon the date of the underwriting agreement related to this offering. The
purpose of the ESPP is to secure the services of new employees, to retain the
services of existing employees, and to provide incentives for such individuals
to exert maximum efforts toward our success and that of our affiliates. The
ESPP includes two components. One component is designed to allow eligible U.S.
employees to purchase our common stock in a manner that may qualify for
favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the Code. In addition, purchase
rights may be granted under a component that does not qualify for such
favorable tax treatment because of deviations necessary to permit
participation by eligible employees who are foreign nationals or employed
outside of the U.S. while complying with applicable foreign laws.

_Share Reserve_. Following this offering, the ESPP authorizes the issuance of
9,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock under purchase rights granted to
our employees or to employees of any of our designated affiliates. The number
of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance will automatically
increase on February 1 of each calendar year, beginning on February 1, 2020
through February 1, 2029, by the lesser of (1) 1% of the total number of
shares of our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the last
day of the fiscal year before the date of the automatic increase, and (2)
7,500,000 shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, our
board of directors may determine that such increase will be less than the
amount set forth in clauses (1) and (2). As of the date hereof, no shares of
our Class A common stock have been purchased under the ESPP.

_Administration_. Our board of directors administers the ESPP and may delegate
its authority to administer the ESPP to our compensation committee. The ESPP
is implemented through a series of offerings under which eligible employees
are granted purchase rights to purchase shares of our Class A common stock on
specified dates during such offerings. Under the ESPP, we may specify
offerings with durations of not more than 27 months, and may specify shorter
purchase periods within each offering. Each offering will have one or more
purchase dates on which shares of our Class A common stock will be purchased
for employees participating in the offering. An offering under the ESPP may be
terminated under certain circumstances.

_Payroll Deductions_. Generally, all regular employees, including executive
officers, employed by us or by any of our designated affiliates, may
participate in the ESPP and may contribute, normally through payroll
deductions, up to 20% of their earnings (as defined in the ESPP) for the
purchase of our Class A common stock under the ESPP. Unless otherwise
determined by our board of directors, Class A common stock will be purchased
for the accounts of employees participating in the ESPP at a price per share
that is at least the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of a share of
our Class A common stock on the first date of an offering, or (2) 85% of the
fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock on the date of
purchase.

_Limitations_. Employees may have to satisfy one or more of the following
service requirements before participating in the ESPP, as determined by our
board of directors, including: (1) being customarily employed for more than 20
hours per week, (2) being customarily employed for more than five months per
calendar year, or (3) continuous employment with us or one of our affiliates
for a period of time (not to exceed two years). No



113

##### Table of Contents

employee may purchase shares under the ESPP at a rate in excess of $25,000
worth of our Class A common stock based on the fair market value per share of
our Class A common stock at the beginning of an offering for each calendar
year such a purchase right is outstanding. Finally, no employee will be
eligible for the grant of any purchase rights under the ESPP if immediately
after such rights are granted, such employee has voting power over 5% or more
of our outstanding capital stock measured by vote or value under Section
424(d) of the Code.

_Changes to Capital Structure_. In the event that there occurs a change in our
capital structure through such actions as a stock split, merger,
consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reincorporation, stock
dividend, dividend in property other than cash, large nonrecurring cash
dividend, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares,
change in corporate structure, or similar transaction, the board of directors
will make appropriate adjustments to: (1) the class(es) and maximum number of
shares reserved under the ESPP, (2) the class(es) and maximum number of shares
by which the share reserve may increase automatically each year, (3) the
class(es) and number of shares subject to and purchase price applicable to
outstanding offerings and purchase rights, and (4) the class(es) and number of
shares that are subject to purchase limits under ongoing offerings.

_Corporate Transactions_. In the event of certain significant corporate
transactions, any then-outstanding rights to purchase our stock under the ESPP
may be assumed, continued, or substituted for by any surviving or acquiring
entity (or its parent company). If the surviving or acquiring entity (or its
parent company) elects not to assume, continue, or substitute for such
purchase rights, then the participants accumulated payroll contributions will
be used to purchase shares of our Class A common stock within 10 business days
before such corporate transaction, and such purchase rights will terminate
immediately after such purchase.

Under the ESPP, a corporate transaction is generally the consummation of: (1)
a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, (2) the sale or disposition
of more than 50% of our outstanding securities, (3) a merger or consolidation
where we do not survive the transaction, and (4) a merger or consolidation
where we do survive the transaction but the shares of our Class A common stock
outstanding immediately before such transaction are converted or exchanged
into other property by virtue of the transaction.

_ESPP Amendment or Termination_. Our board of directors has the authority to
amend or terminate our ESPP, provided that except in certain circumstances
such amendment or termination may not materially impair any outstanding
purchase rights without the holders consent. We will obtain stockholder
approval of any amendment to our ESPP as required by applicable law or listing
requirements.

**Limitations of Liability and Indemnification Matters**

Upon the completion of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation will contain provisions that limit the liability of our current
and former directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware law. Delaware law provides that directors of a corporation will not
be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties
as directors, except liability for:



  |  |   |

any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
stockholders;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions;
or  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
Such limitation of liability does not apply to liabilities arising under
federal securities laws and does not affect the availability of equitable
remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that will be in effect
upon the completion of this offering will authorize us to indemnify our
directors, officers, employees and other agents to the fullest extent



114

* * *

##### Table of Contents

permitted by Delaware law. Our amended and restated bylaws that will be in
effect upon the completion of this offering will provide that we are required
to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware law and may indemnify our other employees and agents. Our amended and
restated bylaws that will be in effect upon the completion of this offering
will also provide that, on satisfaction of certain conditions, we will advance
expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition
of any action or proceeding, and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of
any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out
of his or her actions in that capacity regardless of whether we would
otherwise be permitted to indemnify him or her under the provisions of
Delaware law. We have entered and expect to continue to enter into agreements
to indemnify our directors and executive officers. With certain exceptions,
these agreements provide for indemnification for related expenses including
attorneys fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of
these individuals in connection with any action, proceeding or investigation.
We believe that these amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
amended and restated bylaw provisions and indemnification agreements are
necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers.
We also maintain customary directors and officers liability insurance.

The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may
discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for
breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of
derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an
action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders. Further, a
stockholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay
the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as
required by these indemnification provisions.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
may be permitted for directors, executive officers or persons controlling us,
we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is
against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore
unenforceable.

**Transactions with Digital Mobile Venture Limited**

**_Common Stock Transfer Agreement_**

In May 2017, Mr. Yuan entered into a stock transfer agreement with one of our
investors, Digital Mobile Venture Ltd. (Digital Mobile), a holder of more than
5% of our outstanding capital stock and a fund affiliated with Samuel Chen, a
former member of our board of directors, pursuant to which Mr. Yuan
transferred 2,899,136 shares of our common stock to Digital Mobile and
received $3.74 per share for such transferred shares. We had previously
redeemed 4,000,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock from Digital
Mobile to offset dilution and facilitate our Series D convertible preferred
stock financing. Mr. Yuan, by means of the stock transfer described above, and
another stockholder transferred an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares to Digital
Mobile to replace the shares we had previously redeemed from Digital Mobile.
The purpose of Mr. Yuans stock transfer was not intended to be compensation
paid by us to him. However, under financial accounting standards, we
recognized a portion of the price paid to Mr. Yuan as stock-based
compensation. We waived our right of first refusal in connection with the
stock transfer described above.

the sale of certain shares of our capital stock, including sales by certain of
our executive officers, resulting in the purchase of such shares by certain of
our stockholders, including related persons. See the section titled Principal
and Selling Stockholders for additional information regarding beneficial

**PRINCIPAL AND SELLING STOCKHOLDERS**

The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial
ownership of our capital stock as of March 31, 2019, and as adjusted to
reflect the sale of our Class A common stock offered by us and the selling
stockholders in this offering and the concurrent private placement assuming no
exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares, for:



  |  |   | each of our named executive officers;  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   | each of our directors;  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   | all of our executive officers and directors as a group;  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   | each person or group of affiliated persons known by us to
beneficially own more than 5% of our Class A or Class B common stock; and  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   | each of the selling stockholders.  
---|---|---|---  
  
We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the SEC and the information is not necessarily indicative of
beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Except as indicated by the
footnotes below, we believe, based on information furnished to us, that the
persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and sole
investment power with respect to all shares that they beneficially own,
subject to applicable community property laws.

Applicable percentage ownership before the offering and the concurrent private
placement is based on 6,665,108 shares of Class A common stock and 249,364,915
shares of Class B common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2019, assuming the
automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into shares
of Class B common stock upon the completion of this offering and the
concurrent private placement. Applicable percentage ownership after the
offering and the concurrent private placement is based on 24,072,450 shares of
Class A common stock and 232,318,285 shares of Class B common stock
outstanding immediately after the completion of this offering and the
concurrent private placement, assuming no exercise by the underwriters of
their over-allotment option. In computing the number of shares beneficially
owned by a person and the percentage ownership of such person, we deemed to be
outstanding all shares subject to options held by the person that are
currently exercisable, or exercisable within 60 days of March 31, 2019.
However, except as described above, we did not deem such shares outstanding
for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each beneficial owner listed below
is c/o Zoom Video Communications, Inc., 55 Almaden Boulevard, 6th Floor, San
Jose, California 95113.

##### Table of Contents

**DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK**

**General**

The following is a summary of the rights of our common and preferred stock and
some of the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, which will each become
effective upon the completion of this offering, the amended and restated
investors rights agreement and relevant provisions of Delaware General
Corporation Law. The descriptions herein are qualified in their entirety by
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated
bylaws and amended and restated investors rights agreement, copies of which
have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this
prospectus is a part, as well as the relevant provisions of Delaware General
Corporation Law.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for two classes
of common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Upon
completion of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation will authorize shares of undesignated preferred stock, the
rights, preferences and privileges of which may be designated from time to
time by our board of directors.

Upon the completion of this offering, our authorized capital stock will
consist of the following shares, all with a par value of $0.001 per share, of
which:



  |  |   |

2,000,000,000 shares are designated as Class A common stock;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

300,000,000 shares are designated as Class B common stock; and  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

200,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
As of January 31, 2019, we had no shares of Class A common stock, 90,327,435
shares of Class B common stock and 152,665,804 shares of preferred stock
outstanding (without giving effect to the conversion of outstanding
convertible promissory notes or the shares to be sold in this offering or the
concurrent private placement). After giving effect to the conversion of all
outstanding shares of preferred stock into shares of Class B common stock
immediately upon the completion of this offering, there would have been
242,993,239 shares of Class B common stock outstanding on January 31, 2019,
held by 391 stockholders of record. As of January 31, 2019, we had outstanding
options to acquire 35,064,465 shares of Class B common stock.

**Class  A and Class B Common Stock **

All issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B
common stock will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable. All authorized but unissued shares of our Class A common stock and
Class B common stock will be available for issuance by our board of directors
without any further stockholder action, except as required by the listing
standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. Our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation will provide that, except with respect to voting rights and
conversion rights, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are
treated equally and identically.

**_Voting Rights_**

Holders of Class A common stock will be entitled to one vote per share on all
matters to be voted upon by the stockholders, and holders of Class B common
stock will be entitled to 10 votes per share on all matters to be voted upon
by the stockholders. The holders of our Class A common stock and Class B
common stock will generally vote together as a single class on all matters
submitted to a vote of our stockholders, unless otherwise required by Delaware
law or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Delaware law
would permit holders of Class A common stock to vote separately, as a single
class, if we were to change the par value of the common stock or amend our
certificate of incorporation to alter the powers, preferences or special
rights of the common stock as a whole in a way that would adversely affect the
holders of our Class A common stock.

##### Table of Contents

In addition, Delaware law would permit holders of Class A common stock to vote
separately, as a single class, if an amendment of our certificate of
incorporation would adversely affect them by altering the powers, preferences,
or special rights of the Class A common stock, but not the Class B common
stock. As a result, in these limited instances, the holders of a majority of
the Class A common stock could defeat any amendment to our certificate of
incorporation. For example, if a proposed amendment of our certificate of
incorporation provided for the Class A common stock to rank junior to the
Class B common stock with respect to (i) any dividend or distribution, (ii)
the distribution of proceeds were we to be acquired or (iii) any other right,
Delaware law would require the vote of the Class A common stock. In this
instance, the holders of a majority of Class A common stock could defeat that
amendment to our certificate of incorporation.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that will be in effect
upon the completion of this offering will provide that the number of
authorized shares of preferred stock, Class A common stock or Class B common
stock, may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of
preferred stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding voting power of all of our outstanding, voting together as a
single class. As a result, the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class
B common stock can approve an increase or decrease in the number of authorized
shares of Class A common stock without a separate vote of the holders of Class
A common stock. This could allow us to increase and issue additional shares of
Class A common stock beyond what is currently authorized in our certificate of
incorporation without the consent of the holders of our Class A common stock.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that will be in effect
upon the completion of this offering will not provide for cumulative voting
for the election of directors.

**_Dividend Rights_**

Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be entitled to
ratably receive dividends if, as and when declared from time to time by our
board of directors at its own discretion out of funds legally available for
that purpose, after payment of dividends required to be paid on outstanding
preferred stock, if any. Under Delaware law, we can only pay dividends either
out of surplus or out of the current or the immediately preceding years net
profits. Surplus is defined as the excess, if any, at any given time, of the
total assets of a corporation over its total liabilities and statutory
capital. The value of a corporations assets can be measured in a number of
ways and may not necessarily equal their book value. In addition, holders of
our Class A common stock would be entitled to vote separately as a class on
dividends and distributions if the holders of Class A common stock were
treated adversely. As a result, if the holders of Class A common stock were
treated adversely in any dividend or distribution, the holders of a majority
of Class A common stock could defeat that dividend or distribution.

**_Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions_**

Upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding-up or a deemed liquidation, the
assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders are
distributable ratably among the holders of our Class A common stock and Class
B common stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and
liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation
preferences, if any, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock, unless a
different treatment is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of each class of common stock, including
the Class A common stock, voting separately as a class. __ As a result, the
holders of a majority of each class of common stock, including the Class A
common stock, could defeat a proposed distribution of any assets on our
liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up or deemed liquidation if that
distribution were not to be shared equally, identically, and ratably. If a
change of control transaction is not considered a deemed liquidation, such
transaction shall require the approval of the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of each class of common stock,
including the Class A common stock, voting separately as a class.

**_Subdivisions and Combinations_**

If we subdivide or combine in any manner outstanding shares of Class A common
stock or Class B common stock, the outstanding shares of the other class will
be subdivided or combined in the same manner, unless different treatment of
the shares of each such class is approved by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Class B common stock, each voting separately as a class.

**_Conversion_**

Each share of our Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the
option of the holder into one share of our Class A common stock. In addition,
each share of our Class B common stock will convert automatically into one
share of our Class A common stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value,
except certain transfers to entities, to the extent the transferor retains
sole dispositive power and exclusive voting control with respect to the shares
of Class B common stock, and certain other transfers described in our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation. All outstanding shares of our Class
B common stock will convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon the
earliest of (i) the date that is six months following the death or incapacity
of Mr. Yuan, (ii) the date that is six months following the date that Eric S.
Yuan ceases providing services to us or his employment is terminated by us for
cause, (iii) the date specified by the holders of a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting separately as a class and
(iv) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering.

**_Other Matters_**

The Class A common stock and Class B common stock will have no preemptive
rights pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws. There will be no redemption
or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Class A common stock and Class B
common stock. All outstanding shares of our Class A common stock will be fully
paid and non-assessable, and the shares of our Class A common stock offered in
this offering, upon payment and delivery in accordance with the underwriting
agreement, will be fully paid and non-assessable.

**Preferred Stock**

As of January 31, 2019, there were 152,665,804 shares of preferred stock
outstanding. Immediately upon the completion of this offering, each
outstanding share of preferred stock will convert into one share of Class B
common stock.

Upon the completion of this offering, our board of directors may, without
further action by our stockholders, fix the rights, preferences, privileges
and restrictions of up to an aggregate of 200,000,000 shares of preferred
stock in one or more series and authorize their issuance. These rights,
preferences and privileges could include dividend rights, conversion rights,
voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences, sinking fund
terms and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of
such series, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of our common
stock. The issuance of our preferred stock could adversely affect the voting
power of holders of our common stock and the likelihood that such holders will
receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. In addition, the
issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing a change of control or other corporate action. Upon the completion
of this offering, no shares of preferred stock will be outstanding, and we
have no present plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.

**Options**

As of January 31, 2019, we had outstanding options under our equity
compensation plans to purchase an aggregate of 35,064,465 shares of our Class
B common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of $1.48 per share.

**Registration Rights**

We are party to an amended and restated investors rights agreement that
provides that certain holders of our preferred stock, including certain
holders of at least 1% of our outstanding capital stock, have certain
registration rights as set forth below. The registration of shares of our
common stock by the exercise of registration rights described below would
enable the holders to sell these shares without restriction under the
Securities Act when the applicable registration statement is declared
effective. We will pay the registration expenses, other than underwriting
discounts and commissions, of the shares registered by the demand, piggyback
and Form S-3 registrations described below.

Generally, in an underwritten offering, the managing underwriter, if any, has
the right, subject to specified conditions, to limit the number of shares such
holders may include. The demand, piggyback and Form S-3 registration rights
described below will expire five years after the completion of this offering,
of which this prospectus is a part, or with respect to any particular
stockholder, such time after the completion of this offering that such
stockholder can sell all of its shares entitled to registration rights under
Rule 144 of the Securities Act during any 90-day period.

**_Demand Registration Rights_**

The holders of an aggregate of 156,171,668 shares of our Class B common stock
will be entitled to certain demand registration rights. At any time beginning
180 days after the completion of this offering, the holders of a majority of
these shares may request that we register all or a portion of their shares. We
are obligated to effect only two such registrations. Such request for
registration must cover shares with an anticipated aggregate offering price,
net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of at least $10 million.

**_Piggyback Registration Rights_**

In connection with this offering, the holders of an aggregate of 209,264,532
shares of our Class B common stock were entitled to, and the necessary
percentage of holders waived, their rights to notice of this offering and to
include their shares of registrable securities in this offering. After this
offering, in the event that we propose to register any of our securities under
the Securities Act, either for our own account or for the account of other
security holders, the holders of these shares and the shares to be sold in the
concurrent private placement will be entitled to certain piggyback
registration rights allowing the holder to include their shares in such
registration, subject to certain marketing and other limitations. As a result,
whenever we propose to file a registration statement under the Securities Act,
other than with respect to (i) a registration relating solely to employee
benefit plans, (ii) a registration relating to the offer and sale of debt
securities, (iii) a registration relating to a corporate reorganization or
other Rule 145 transaction, or (iv) a registration on any registration form
that does not permit secondary sales, the holders of these shares are entitled
to notice of the registration and have the right to include their shares in
the registration, subject to limitations that the underwriters may impose on
the number of shares included in the offering.

**_Form S-3 Registration Rights _**

The holders of an aggregate of 156,171,668 shares of Class B common stock will
be entitled to certain Form S-3 registration rights. The holders of these
shares can make a request that we register their shares on Form S-3 if we are
qualified to file a registration statement on Form S-3 and if the reasonably
anticipated aggregate gross proceeds of the shares offered would equal or
exceed $1 million. We will not be required to effect more than two
registrations on Form S-3 within any 12-month period.

**Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law and Our Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws**

Some provisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain or will contain
provisions that could make the following transactions more difficult: an
acquisition of us by means of a tender offer; an acquisition of us by means of
a proxy contest or otherwise; or



127

* * *

##### Table of Contents

the removal of our incumbent officers and directors. It is possible that these
provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter
transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best
interest or in our best interests, including transactions which provide for
payment of a premium over the market price for our shares.

These provisions, summarized below, are intended to discourage coercive
takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also
designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first
negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of the
increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent
of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh
the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because negotiation of these
proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.

**_Dual Class  Stock _**

As described above in Class A and Class B Common StockVoting Rights, our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class
common stock structure, which provides our founders, current investors,
executives and employees with significant influence over all matters requiring
stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant
corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our
assets.

**_Stockholder Meetings_**

Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that a special meeting of
stockholders may be called only by our chairperson of the board, chief
executive officer, or by a resolution adopted by a majority of our board of
directors.

**_Requirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and
Proposals_**

Our amended and restated bylaws will establish advance notice procedures with
respect to stockholder proposals to be brought before a stockholder meeting
and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than
nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or a
committee of the board of directors.

**_Elimination of Stockholder Action by Written Consent_**

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
bylaws will eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent
without a meeting.

**_Staggered Board_**

Our board of directors will be divided into three classes. The directors in
each class will serve for a three-year term, one class being elected each year
by our stockholders. For more information on the classified board, see
ManagementComposition of our Board Directors. This system of electing and
removing directors may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender
offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us because it generally
makes it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majority of the
directors.

**_Removal of Directors_**

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that no
member of our board of directors may be removed from office by our
stockholders except for cause and, in addition to any other vote required by
law, upon the approval of not less than two thirds of the total voting power
of all of our outstanding voting stock then entitled to vote in the election
of directors.

##### Table of Contents

**_Stockholders Not Entitled to Cumulative Voting_**

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not permit
stockholders to cumulate their votes in the election of directors.
Accordingly, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common
stock entitled to vote in any election of directors can elect all of the
directors standing for election, if they choose, other than any directors that
holders of our preferred stock may be entitled to elect.

**_Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute_**

We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which
prohibits persons deemed to be interested stockholders from engaging in a
business combination with a publicly held Delaware corporation for three
years following the date these persons become interested stockholders unless
the business combination is, or the transaction in which the person became an
interested stockholder was, approved in a prescribed manner or another
prescribed exception applies. Generally, an interested stockholder is a
person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three
years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15%
or more of a corporations voting stock. Generally, a business combination
includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a
financial benefit to the interested stockholder. The existence of this
provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not
approved in advance by the board of directors.

**_Choice of Forum_**

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that,
unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative form, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive
forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware
statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on
our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty or
other wrongdoing by any of our directors, officers or employees to us or our
stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our
directors or officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of
the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or
bylaws; (iv) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or
determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; (v) any
action or proceeding as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers
jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (vi) any
action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the
federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive
forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under
the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the
State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation will also provide that any
person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of
our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to
these choice of forum provisions. It is possible that a court of law could
rule that either choice of forum provision to be contained in our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation is inapplicable or unenforceable if it
is challenged in a proceeding or otherwise.

**_Amendment of Charter Provisions_**

The amendment of any of the above provisions, except for the provision making
it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock, would require
approval by holders of at least two-thirds of the total voting power of all of
our outstanding voting stock.

The provisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could have the effect of
discouraging others from attempting hostile takeovers, and as a consequence,
they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our Class
A common stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover
attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in
the composition of our board and management. It is possible that these
provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that
stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.

**SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE**

Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A common
stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock in the
public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely
affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Although we have been
approved to have our Class A common stock listed on The Nasdaq Global Select
Market, we cannot assure you that there will be an active public market for
our Class A common stock.

Following the completion of this offering and the concurrent private
placement, based on the number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class
B common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2019 and assuming (i) the
issuance of shares of Class A common stock in this offering, (ii) the
conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock into
152,665,804 shares of Class B common stock, which will automatically occur
immediately prior to the completion of the offering, (iii) the conversion of
10,674,954 shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock upon the
sale of such shares by the selling stockholders, as well as the issuance of
283,177 shares of our Class B common stock and the subsequent conversion of
such shares into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock
upon the exercise of options held by certain selling stockholders in
connection with the sale of such shares by such selling stockholders in this
offering and (iv) no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option, we
will have outstanding an aggregate of approximately 24,070,086 shares of Class
A common stock and 232,318,285 shares of Class B common stock.

Of these shares, all shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering will
be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the
Securities Act, except for any shares of Class A common stock purchased by our
affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
Shares purchased by our affiliates would be subject to the Rule 144 resale
restrictions described below, other than the holding period requirement.

The Class B common stock outstanding after this offering will be restricted
securities, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
These restricted securities are eligible for public sale only if they are
registered under the Securities Act or if they qualify for an exemption from
registration under Rules 144 or 701 under the Securities Act, each of which is
summarized below. All of these shares will be subject to a 180-day lock-up
period under the lock-up agreements and market standoff agreements described
below.

In addition, of the 35,064,465 shares of our Class B common stock that were
subject to stock options outstanding as of January 31, 2019, of which options
to purchase 19,132,388 shares of Class B common stock were vested as of such
date, upon exercise, these shares will be eligible for sale subject to the
lockup agreements described below and Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities
Act.

**Lock-Up Agreements and Market Standoff Provisions **

We, along with our directors, executive officers and substantially all of our
other stockholders and optionholders, have agreed with the underwriters that
for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to
specified exceptions as detailed further in Underwriters below, we or they
will not offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to
purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or
warrant for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of or transfer any shares of
Class A common stock and Class B common stock or any securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock and
Class B common stock, request or demand that we file a registration statement
related to our common stock or enter into any swap or other agreement that
transfers to another, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the
economic consequence of ownership of the common stock. All of our stockholders
are subject to a market stand-off agreement with us that imposes similar
restrictions.

In general, beginning 90 days after the effective date of the registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part, a person who is an affiliate of
ours, or who was an affiliate at any time during the 90 days before a sale,
and who has beneficially owned shares of our capital stock for at least six
months would be entitled to sell in brokers transactions or certain
riskless principal transactions or to market makers, a number of shares
within any three-month period that does not exceed the greater of:

Affiliate resales under Rule 144 are also subject to the availability of
current public information about us. In addition, if the number of shares
being sold under Rule 144 by an affiliate during any three-month period
exceeds 5,000 shares or has an aggregate sale price in excess of $50,000, the
seller must file a notice on Form 144 concurrently with either the placing of
a sale order with the broker or the execution of a sale directly with a market
maker.

**_Non-Affiliate Resales of Restricted Securities _**

In general, beginning 90 days after the effective date of the registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part, a person who is not an affiliate
of ours at the time of sale, and has not been an affiliate at any time during
the 90 days preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned shares of our
capital stock for at least six months but less than a year, is entitled to
sell such shares subject only to the availability of current public
information about us. If such person has held our shares for at least one
year, such person can resell under Rule 144(b)(1) without regard to any Rule
144 restrictions, including the 90-day public company requirement and the
current public information requirement.

Non-affiliate resales are not subject to the manner of sale, volume limitation
or notice filing provisions of Rule 144.

**Rule 701**

In general, under Rule 701, any of our employees, directors, officers,
consultants or advisors who purchases shares from us in connection with a
compensatory stock or option plan or other written agreement before the
effective date of a registration statement under the Securities Act is
entitled to sell such shares 90 days after such effective date in reliance on
Rule 144\. Securities issued in reliance on Rule 701 are restricted securities
and, subject to the contractual restrictions described above, beginning 90
days after the date of this prospectus, may be sold by persons other than
affiliates, as defined in Rule 144, subject only to the manner of sale
provisions of

Rule 144 and by affiliates under Rule 144 without compliance with its one-
year minimum holding period requirement. However, substantially all Rule 701
shares are subject to lock-up agreements as described above and will become

agreements.

**Form S-8 Registration Statement **

We intend to file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the
Securities Act to register all shares of Class B common stock subject to
outstanding stock options and Class A common stock issued or issuable under
the 2019 Plan, the 2011 Plan and the ESPP. We expect to file the registration
statement covering shares offered pursuant to these stock plans shortly after
the date of this prospectus, permitting the resale of such shares by non-
affiliates in the public market without restriction under the Securities Act
and the sale by affiliates in the public market subject to compliance with the
resale provisions of Rule 144.

**Registration Rights**

As of January 31, 2019, holders of up to 209,264,532 shares of our Class B
common stock, which includes all of the shares of Class B common stock
issuable upon the automatic conversion of our convertible preferred stock
immediately prior to the completion of this offering and the concurrent
private placement, or their transferees, will be entitled to various rights
with respect to the registration of these shares under the Securities Act upon
the completion of this offering and the expiration of lock-up agreements.
Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in these
shares becoming fully tradable without restriction under the Securities Act
immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration, except for shares
purchased by affiliates. See Description of Capital StockRegistration
Rights for additional information. Shares covered by a registration statement
will be eligible for sale in the public market upon the expiration or release
from the terms of the lock-up agreement.

**MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS OF OUR
CLASS A COMMON STOCK **

The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences to non-U.S. holders (as defined below) of the acquisition,
ownership and disposition of our Class A common stock issued pursuant to this
offering. This discussion is not a complete analysis of all potential U.S.
federal income tax consequences relating thereto, does not address the
potential application of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment
income or the alternative minimum tax, and does not address any estate or gift
tax consequences or any tax consequences arising under any state, local or
foreign tax laws, or any other U.S. federal tax laws. This discussion is based
on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and published rulings
and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS),
all as in effect as of the date of this prospectus. These authorities are
subject to differing interpretations and may change, possibly retroactively,
resulting in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those
discussed below. We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to
the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and
there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with such
statements and conclusions.

This discussion is limited to non-U.S. holders who purchase our Class A common
stock pursuant to this offering and who hold our Class A common stock as a
capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,
property held for investment). This discussion does not address all of the
U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a particular
holder in light of such holders particular circumstances. This discussion
also does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may be
relevant to holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax
laws, including:



  |  |   |

certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.
Partnerships holding our Class A common stock and the partners in such
partnerships are urged to consult their tax advisors about the particular U.S.
federal income tax consequences to them of holding and disposing of our Class
A common stock.

**THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE.
PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE
PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF ACQUIRING, OWNING
AND DISPOSING OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES
ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS AND ANY OTHER U.S. FEDERAL
TAX LAWS. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS WERE
RECENTLY ENACTED. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO CONSULT WITH THEIR TAX
ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAW AS WELL AS POTENTIAL
CONFORMING CHANGES IN STATE TAX LAWS.**

**Definition of Non-U.S. Holder **

For purposes of this discussion, a non-U.S. holder is any beneficial owner of
our Class A common stock that is not a U.S. person or a partnership
(including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. A U.S. person is any person that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:



  |  |   |

an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

a corporation (or any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income
tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof or the District of Columbia;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax
regardless of its source; or  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

a trust (i) whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of a
U.S. court and which has one or more U.S. persons who have the authority to
control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) that has a valid
election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a
U.S. person.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
**Distributions on Our Class  A Common Stock **

As described under the section titled Dividend Policy, we have not paid and
do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
However, if we make cash or other property distributions on our Class A common
stock, such distributions will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income
tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and
profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Amounts that
exceed such current and accumulated earnings and profits and, therefore, are
not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes will constitute
a return of capital and will first be applied against and reduce a holders
tax basis in our Class A common stock, but not below zero. Any excess amount
distributed will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition
of our Class A common stock and will be treated as described under the section
titled Gain On Disposition of Our Class A Common Stock below.

Subject to the discussion below regarding effectively connected income, backup
withholding and FATCA (as defined below), dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder
of our Class A common stock generally will be subject to U.S. federal
withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividends or such
lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty. To receive the
benefit of a reduced treaty rate, a non-U.S. holder must furnish us or the
applicable withholding agent a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or
applicable successor form) certifying such holders qualification for the
reduced rate. This certification must be provided to us or the withholding
agent before the payment of dividends and must be updated periodically. If the
non-U.S. holder holds the stock through a financial institution or other agent
acting on the non-U.S. holders behalf, the non-U.S. holder will be required
to provide appropriate documentation to the agent, which then will be required
to provide certification to us or the withholding agent, either directly or
through other intermediaries.

##### Table of Contents

If a non-U.S. holder holds our Class A common stock in connection with the
conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and dividends paid on our
Class A common stock are effectively connected with such holders U.S. trade
or business (and are attributable to such holders permanent establishment or
fixed base in the United States if required by an applicable tax treaty), the
non-U.S. holder will be exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax. To claim the
exemption, the non-U.S. holder must generally furnish a valid IRS Form W-8ECI
(or applicable successor form) to the applicable withholding agent.

However, any such effectively connected dividends paid on our Class A common
stock generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income
basis at the regular U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if
such holder were a resident of the United States. A non-U.S. holder that is a
foreign corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax
equal to 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty)
of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, as
adjusted for certain items.

Non-U.S. holders that do not provide the required certification on a timely
basis, but that qualify for a reduced treaty rate, may obtain a refund of any
excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with
the IRS.

Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable
income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.

**Gain on Disposition of Our Class  A Common Stock **

Subject to the discussion below regarding backup withholding and FATCA, a
non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of our Class A common
stock, unless:



  |  |   |

the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holders conduct of a
trade or business in the United States and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base
maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States;  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United
States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition and
certain other requirements are met; or  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

our Class A common stock constitutes a United States real property interest
by reason of our status as a United States real property holding corporation
(USRPHC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time within the shorter
of the five-year period preceding the disposition or the non-U.S. holders
holding period for our Class A common stock, and our Class A common stock is
not regularly traded on an established securities market during the calendar
year in which the sale or other disposition occurs.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
Determining whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of our
U.S. real property interests relative to the fair market value of our other
trade or business assets and our foreign real property interests. We believe
that we are not currently and do not anticipate becoming a USRPHC for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, although there can be no assurance we will not in
the future become a USRPHC.

Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular U.S. federal
income tax rates in the same manner as if such holder were a resident of the
United States. A non-U.S. holder that is a foreign corporation also may be
subject to an additional branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate
specified by an applicable income tax treaty) of its effectively connected
earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items. Gain
described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at a flat 30% rate (or such lower rate specified by an applicable
income tax treaty), but may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses
(even though the individual



136

* * *

##### Table of Contents

is not considered a resident of the United States), provided that the non-U.S.
holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such
losses. Gain described in the third bullet point above will generally be
subject to U.S. federal income tax in the same manner as gain that is
effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (subject to
any provisions under an applicable income tax treaty), except that the branch
profits tax generally will not apply. Non-U.S. holders should consult their
tax advisors regarding any applicable income tax treaties that may provide for
different rules.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

Annual reports are required to be filed with the IRS and provided to each
non-U.S. holder indicating the amount of dividends on our Class A common stock
paid to such holder and the amount of any tax withheld with respect to those
dividends. These information reporting requirements apply even if no
withholding was required because the dividends were effectively connected with
the holders conduct of a U.S. trade or business, or withholding was reduced
or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty. This information also may be
made available under a specific treaty or agreement with the tax authorities
in the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. Backup
withholding, currently at a 24% rate, generally will not apply to payments to
a non-U.S. holder of dividends on or the gross proceeds of a disposition of
our Class A common stock provided the non-U.S. holder furnishes the required
certification for its non-U.S. status, such as by providing a valid IRS Form
W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or IRS Form W-8ECI (or applicable successor form),
or certain other requirements are met. Backup withholding may apply if the
payor has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the holder is a U.S.
person who is not an exempt recipient.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. If any amount is withheld under
the backup withholding rules, the non-U.S. holder should consult with a U.S.
tax advisor regarding the possibility of and procedure for obtaining a refund
or a credit against the non-U.S. holders U.S. federal income tax liability,
if any.

**Withholding on Foreign Entities**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (commonly referred to as FATCA) impose
a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain payments made to a foreign
financial institution (as specially defined under these rules) unless such
institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on
certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities
substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such
institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such
institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with
U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a U.S.
federal withholding tax of 30% on certain payments made to a non-financial
foreign entity unless such entity either certifies that it does not have any
substantial United States owners as defined in the Code or provides the
withholding agent a certification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S.
owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement
between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these
requirements. Under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. holder might be eligible
for refunds or credits of such taxes. Under the applicable Treasury
Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally
applies to payments of dividends on our common stock, and will apply to
payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such stock on
or after January 1, 2019, although under recently issued proposed regulations
(the preamble to which specifies that taxpayers are permitted to rely on such
proposed regulations pending finalization), no withholding would apply with
respect to payments of gross proceeds.

Prospective investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors
regarding the possible implications of FATCA on their investment in our Class
A common stock.

The underwriters and the representatives are collectively referred to as the
underwriters and the representatives, respectively. The underwriters are
offering the shares of Class A common stock subject to their receipt and
acceptance of the shares from us and the selling stockholders and subject to
prior sale and the underwriters right to reject any order in whole or in
part. The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the several
underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the shares of Class A common
stock offered by this prospectus are subject to the approval of certain legal
matters by their counsel and to certain other conditions. The underwriters are
obligated to take and pay for all of the shares of Class A common stock
offered by this prospectus if any such shares are taken. However, the
underwriters are not required to take or pay for the shares covered by the
underwriters over-allotment option described below.

The underwriters initially propose to offer part of the shares of Class A
common stock directly to the public at the offering price listed on the cover
page of this prospectus and part to certain dealers. After the initial
offering of the shares of common stock, the offering price and other selling
terms may from time to time be varied by the representatives.

We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from
the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to 3,130,435 additional shares of
Class A common stock at the public offering price listed on the cover page of
this prospectus, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters
may exercise this option solely for the purpose of covering the over-
allotments, if any, made in connection with the offering of the shares of
Class A common stock offered by this prospectus. To the extent the option is
exercised, each underwriter will become obligated, subject to certain
conditions, to purchase about the same percentage of the additional shares of
Class A common stock as the number listed next to the underwriters name in
the preceding table bears to the total number of shares of Class A common
stock listed next to the names of all underwriters in the preceding table.

In order to facilitate the offering of the Class A common stock, the
underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise
affect the price of the Class A common stock. Specifically, the underwriters
may sell more shares than they are obligated to purchase under the
underwriting agreement, creating a short



141

position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no greater than the
number of shares available for purchase by the underwriters under the over-
allotment option. The underwriters can close out a covered short sale by
exercising the over-allotment option or purchasing shares in the open market.
In determining the source of shares to close out a covered short sale, the
underwriters will consider, among other things, the open market price of
shares compared to the price available under the over-allotment option. The
underwriters may also sell shares in excess of the over-allotment option,
creating a naked short position. The underwriters must close out any naked
short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position
is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may
be downward pressure on the price of the Class A common stock in the open
market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in
this offering. As an additional means of facilitating this offering, the
underwriters may bid for, and purchase, shares of Class A common stock in the
open market to stabilize the price of the Class A common stock. These
activities may raise or maintain the market price of the Class A common stock
above independent market levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market
price of the Class A common stock. The underwriters are not required to engage
in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time.

We, the selling stockholders and the underwriters have agreed to indemnify
each other against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act.

A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on websites maintained
by one or more underwriters, or selling group members, if any, participating
in this offering. The representatives may agree to allocate a number of shares
of Class A common stock to underwriters for sale to their online brokerage
account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by the
representatives to underwriters that may make Internet distributions on the
same basis as other allocations.

The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial
institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities
trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and
brokerage activities. Certain of the underwriters and their respective
affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform,
various financial advisory and investment banking services for us, for which
they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain of the
underwriters and their respective affiliates are our customers or have been
customers from time to time and may be customers in the future in arms length
transactions on market competitive terms.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their various business activities, the
underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for
their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time
hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such
investment and securities activities may involve our securities and
instruments. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make
investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in
respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such
securities and instruments.

**Pricing of the Offering**

Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A common
stock. The initial public offering price was determined by negotiations
between us, the selling stockholders and the representatives. Among the
factors considered in determining the initial public offering price was our
future prospects and those of our industry in general, our sales, earnings and
certain other financial and operating information in recent periods, and the
price-earnings ratios, price-sales ratios, market prices of securities and
certain financial and operating information of companies engaged in activities
similar to ours.

warranted, acknowledged and agreed to and with each Representative and the
Company that (i) it is a qualified investor within the meaning of the law in
that Member State implementing Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Directive;
and (ii) in the case of any securities acquired by it as a financial

such offer. Neither the Company nor the representatives have authorized, nor
do they authorize, the making of any offer of securities in circumstances in
which an obligation arises for the company or the representatives to publish a
prospectus for such offer.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an offer to the public in
relation to any shares of our common stock in any Relevant Member State means
the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on
the terms of the offer and any shares of our common stock to be offered so as
to enable an investor to decide to purchase any shares of our common stock, as
the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the
Prospectus Directive in that Member State, the expression Prospectus
Directive **** means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including
the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to the extent implemented in the Relevant
Member State), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant
Member State, and the expression 2010 PD Amending Directive **** means ****

**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM**

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

Zoom Video Communications, Inc.:

**_Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Zoom Video
Communications, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of January 31, 2019 and
2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income
(loss), convertible preferred stock and stockholders deficit, and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2019, and the
related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2019 and
2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

We have served as the Companys auditor since 2016.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1\. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Description of Business_**

Zoom Video Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, Zoom, the
Company, we, us, or our) provide video communications services through a
video-first communications platform. Our platform combines video, audio,
phone, screen sharing and chat functionalities. The Company was incorporated
in the state of Delaware in April 2011 and is headquartered in San Jose,
California.

**_Fiscal Year_**

Our fiscal year ends on January 31\. References to fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019,
refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

**_Basis of Presentation_**

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of Zoom Video Communications,
Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

**_Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet Information_**

We have presented unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet information
as of January 31, 2019 in order to show the assumed effect on the balance
sheet of the automatic conversion of (i) the outstanding convertible preferred
stock upon the consummation of a qualified initial public offering (IPO) as
described in Note 7; and (ii) the convertible promissory notes and accrued
interest and the related reclassification of the embedded derivative
liabilities as described in Note 5. Upon the consummation of an IPO, all of
the shares of outstanding convertible preferred stock will automatically
convert into 152,665,804 shares of Class B common stock, and all outstanding
convertible promissory notes and accrued interest will automatically convert
into a number of shares of Class A common stock based on the offering price in
the IPO. The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet information does
not give effect to any proceeds from the assumed IPO.

**_Stock Split_**

In January 2018, our board of directors approved the amendment and restatement
of the Companys certificate of incorporation to effect a four-for-one forward
stock split of the Companys common stock and convertible preferred stock
(collectively, the Capital Stock), which became effective on January 3, 2018.
Accordingly, (i) each one share of outstanding Capital Stock was split into
four shares of Capital Stock of the same class and series, as applicable; (ii)
the number of shares of Capital Stock issuable upon the exercise of each
outstanding option to purchase Capital Stock was proportionately increased on
a four-for-one basis; (iii) the exercise price of each outstanding option to
purchase Capital Stock was proportionately reduced on a four-for-one basis;
(iv) the authorized number of each class and series of Capital Stock was
proportionally increased in accordance with the four-for-one stock split; and
(v) the par value of each class of Capital Stock was not adjusted as result of
this stock split. All of the share numbers, share prices, and exercise prices
have been adjusted retroactively within these financial statements to reflect
this stock split.

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of



F-8

##### Table of Contents

**ZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS, INC.**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**



contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are
not limited to, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred contract
acquisition costs, the allowance for doubtful accounts, the useful lives of
long-lived assets, the valuation of derivative liabilities, the value of
common stock and other assumptions used to measure stock-based compensation,
sales and other tax liabilities, the valuation of deferred income tax assets
and uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

**_Concentration of Risks_**

Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities,
restricted cash and accounts receivable. We maintain our cash, cash
equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash with high-quality
financial institutions with investment-grade ratings. A majority of the cash
balances are with U.S. banks and are insured to the extent defined by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at
January 31, 2018 or 2019. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of
total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 or 2019.

**_Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash_**

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid
investments, primarily money market funds, purchased with an original maturity
of three months or less.

Restricted cash consists of certificates of deposit collateralizing our
operating leases and corporate credit cards. We have $0.7 million and $2.3
million of restricted cash as of January 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively,
which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other
assets, non-current in the consolidated balance sheets.

The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and
restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to
the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of
cash flows:

**_Marketable Securities_**

Marketable securities consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper,
corporate bonds, agency bonds and U.S. government agency securities. We
classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of
purchase and reevaluate such classification at each balance sheet date. We may
sell these securities at any time



F-9

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**



for use in current operations even if they have not yet reached maturity. As a
result, we classify our securities, including those with maturities beyond 12
months, as current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. We carry these
securities at fair value and record unrealized gains and losses in accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), which is reflected as a component of
stockholders (deficit) equity. We evaluate our securities to assess whether
those with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired. We
consider impairments to be other than temporary if they are related to
deterioration in credit risk or if it is likely we will sell the securities
before the recovery of their cost basis. Realized gains and losses from the
sale of marketable securities and declines in value deemed to be other than
temporary are determined based on the specific identification method. Realized
gains and losses are reported in other income, net in the consolidated
statements of operations.

**_Fair Value Measurements_**

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from the
sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants on the measurement date. We measure financial
assets and liabilities at fair value at each reporting period using a fair
value hierarchy which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial
instruments classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three
levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2  Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or
indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted
prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or
can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term
of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or
liabilities.

Financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable
securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, convertible promissory
notes and derivative liabilities. Cash equivalents, restricted cash,
marketable securities and derivative liabilities are stated at fair value on a
recurring basis. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at their
carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the
expected receipt or payment date. The principal amount of the convertible
promissory notes approximate fair value as the stated interest rates
approximate market rates currently available to us.

**_Accounts Receivable_**

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and amounts for which
revenue has been recognized but not invoiced, net of allowance for doubtful
accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of
the collectability of accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the
allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. In
establishing any required allowance, management considers historical losses
adjusted to take into account current market conditions and our customers
financial condition, the amount of any receivables in dispute, the current
receivables aging and the current payment terms. Accounts receivable deemed
uncollectable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when
identified. There were no material impairment losses related to accounts
receivable in the periods presented.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**



**_Property and Equipment, Net_**

Property and equipment, net, are stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, determined to be three to
five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of five years. Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Significant improvements
and betterments that substantially enhance the life of an asset are
capitalized.

**_Software Development Costs_**

We capitalize certain development costs related to our video-first
communications platform during the application development stage. Costs
incurred in the preliminary stages of development are analogous to research
and development activities and are expensed as incurred. The preliminary stage
includes activities such as conceptual formulation of alternatives, evaluation
of alternatives, determination of existence of needed technology and final
selection of alternatives. Once the application development stage is reached,
internal and external costs are capitalized until the software is
substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized software
development costs are recorded as part of property and equipment, net.
Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software
development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the softwares
estimated useful life, which is generally three years, and are recorded in
cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Capitalized
software development costs were not material to our consolidated financial
statements during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 or 2018. We have
capitalized $2.5 million of software development costs during the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2019.

**_Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_**

We evaluate long-lived assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events
indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be
recoverable based on expected future cash flows attributable to that asset or
asset group. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparing
the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group to estimated undiscounted
future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If
the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds estimated undiscounted
future cash flows, then an impairment charge would be recognized based on the
excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair value.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or
fair value less costs to sell. There were no impairment charges recognized
related to long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017,
2018 or 2019.

**_Deferred Offering Costs_**

Deferred offering costs consist primarily of accounting, legal, and other fees
related to our proposed IPO. Upon consummation of the IPO, the deferred
offering costs will be reclassified to shareholders (deficit) equity and
recorded against the proceeds from the offering. In the event the offering is
aborted, deferred offering costs will be expensed. We capitalized $2.4 million
of deferred offering costs within other assets, non-current in the
consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2019. No offering costs were
capitalized as of January 31, 2018.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

We derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access
to our video-first communications platform and services. We elected to adopt
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, _Revenue from Contracts
with Customers_ (ASC 606), effective as of February 1, 2017, utilizing the
full retrospective method of adoption. Accordingly, the consolidated financial
statements for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 are
presented under ASC 606.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**



In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains
control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the
consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services. To
achieve the core principle of this standard, we apply the following five
steps:

_1\. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer_

We determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is
approved, each partys rights regarding the services to be transferred can be
identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer
has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance.
At contract inception, we will evaluate whether two or more contracts should
be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or
single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply
judgment in determining the customers ability and intent to pay, which is
based on a variety of factors, including the customers historical payment
experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information
pertaining to the customer.

_2\. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract_

Performance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the
services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of
being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on
its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third
parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby
the transfer of the services and the products is separately identifiable from
other promises in the contract. Our performance obligations generally consist
of access to our video-first communications platform and related support
services which is considered one performance obligation. Our customers do not
have the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our
platform we provide a series of distinct software-based services that are
satisfied over the term of the subscription.

We also provide services, which include professional services, consulting
services and online event hosting, which are generally considered distinct
from the access to our video-first communications platform.

_3\. Determination of the transaction price_

The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we
expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer.
Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our
judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative
revenue recognized under the contract will not occur. None of our contracts
contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any
taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental
entities (e.g., sales and other indirect taxes).

Our video-first communications platform and related support services are
typically warranted to perform in a professional manner that will comply with
the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include service
level commitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime
reliability and performance and permitting those customers to receive credits
in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits
represent a form of variable consideration. Historically, we have not
experienced any significant incidents affecting the defined levels of
reliability and performance as required by the subscription agreements. We
have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements in the
consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**



_4\. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the
contract_

Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation
of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on each
performance obligations relative standalone selling price. As noted above,
access to our video-first communications platform and related support services
are considered one performance obligation in the context of the contract and
accordingly the transaction price is allocated to this single performance
obligation.

_5\. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is
satisfied_

Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is
satisfied by transferring the control of the promised service to a customer.
Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we
expect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our
video-first communications platform and related support services are
subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation, and the
related revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period as we
satisfy the performance obligation.

Services are time-based arrangements and revenue is recognized as these
services are performed. Fees for services represent less than 3% of revenue in
the periods presented.

_Disaggregation of Revenue_

The following table summarizes revenue by region based on the billing address
of customers:

_Contract Balances_

We receive payments from customers based on a billing schedule as established
in our customer contracts. Accounts receivable are recorded when we
contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right
to consideration for our performance under the customer contract may occur
before invoicing to the customer, resulting in an unbilled accounts
receivable. The amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within
accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets was $2.5 million
and $7.2 million as of January 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we
have the right to invoice in advance of performance under a customer contract.
The current portion of deferred revenue balances are recognized during the
following 12-month period. The amount of revenue recognized during the fiscal
years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 that was included in deferred
revenue at the beginning of each period was $7.1 million, $21.3 million and
$50.3 million, respectively.

_Remaining Performance Obligation_

The terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual and multi-year,
and we may bill for the full term in advance or on an annual or monthly basis,
depending on the customer preference. As of January 31, 2019, the aggregate
amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations
was $311.7 million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount
of $125.8 million and unbilled consideration in the amount of $185.9 million
that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 67% of our
remaining performance obligations as revenue in fiscal 2020, and the remainder
thereafter.

_Cost to Obtain a Contract_

We capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal
sales personnel that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts.
These costs are recorded as deferred contract acquisition costs on the
consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred
based on our sales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental
and would not have occurred absent the customer contract.

Sales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are
amortized over an estimated period of benefit of three years, which is
typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts. We do
not pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on
a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. We
determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of
the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial
estimated customer life and the technological life of our video-first
communications platform and related significant features. Amortization of
deferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense
in the consolidated statements of operations.

We periodically review these deferred contract acquisition costs to determine
whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the
period of benefit. There were no impairment losses recorded during the periods
presented.

The following table represents a rollforward of deferred contract acquisition
costs:

**_Cost of Revenue_**

Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our video-first
communications platform and providing general operating support services to
our customers. These costs are comprised of co-located data center costs,
third-party cloud hosting costs, integrated third-party public switched
telephone network (PSTN)

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**



services, personnel-related expenses, amortization of capitalized software
development costs and allocated overhead costs. Indirect overhead associated
with corporate facilities and related depreciation is allocated to cost of
revenue and operating expenses based on applicable headcount.

**_Research and Development_**

Research and development costs include personnel-related expenses associated
with our engineering personnel and consultants responsible for the design,
development and testing of our video-first communications platform,
depreciation of equipment used in research and development and allocated
overhead costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

**_Advertising Costs_**

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense and
amounted to $3.7 million, $17.1 million and $36.1 million for the fiscal years
ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

**_Leases_**

We categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases.
In certain lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other
incentives. For operating leases, we recognize lease costs on a straight-line
basis once control of the space is achieved, without regard to deferred
payment terms such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of
required payments. Additionally, incentives received are treated as a
reduction of costs over the term of the agreement.

**_Stock-Based Compensation_**

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock awards is recognized based
on the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of each option award
is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the
expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our
common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our
common stock. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the option
awards represent managements best estimates. These estimates involve inherent
uncertainties and the application of managements judgment. The related stock-
based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period of the awards, which is generally four years. We
account for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating the number of
awards expected to be forfeited.

**_Foreign Currency_**

The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.
Accordingly, monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are
re-measured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the reporting
date, non-monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured at historical rates,
and revenue and expenses are re-measured at average exchange rates in effect
during each reporting period. Foreign currency related gains and losses have
been immaterial in the periods presented.

**_Income Taxes_**

We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets



F-15

* * *

##### Table of Contents

**ZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS, INC.**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**



and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that
will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We must then
assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized.
A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a
deferred tax asset will not be fully realized. Due to our lack of earnings
history, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation
allowance.

We recognize benefits of uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not
that such positions will be sustained upon examination based solely on their
technical merits at the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not
to be realized upon the ultimate settlement. Our policy is to recognize
interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a
component of income tax expense or benefit. To date, there have been no
interest or penalties charged in relation to the unrecognized tax benefits.

**_Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders_**

We calculate our net income (loss) per share attributable to Class A and Class
B common stock using the two-class method required for companies with
participating securities. We consider our convertible preferred stock and
unvested common stock, which includes early exercised stock options and
restricted stock awards, to be participating securities as holders of such
securities have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our
declaration of a dividend for shares of common stock. During the periods when
we are in a net loss position, the net loss attributable to common
stockholders was not allocated to the convertible preferred stock and unvested
common stock under the two-class method as these securities do not have a
contractual obligation to share in our losses.

Distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities
are subtracted from net income (loss) in determining net income attributable
to common stockholders. Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by
dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-
average number of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock outstanding.

The diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is
computed by giving effect to all dilutive securities. Diluted net income per
share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the
resulting net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-
average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding. During the periods
when there is a net loss attributable to common stockholders, potentially
dilutive common stock equivalents have been excluded from the calculation of
diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as their effect
is anti-dilutive.

**_Unaudited Pro Forma Net Income Per Share  Attributable to Common
Stockholders _**

Unaudited pro forma basic and diluted net income per share attributable to
common stockholders for fiscal 2019 has been computed to give effect to the
conversion of convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory notes and
accrued interest into common stock as of the beginning of the period or the
original date of issuance, if later.

**_Segment Information_**

We operate in one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as
components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief
Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing
performance. Our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and
assesses performance based upon consolidated financial information.

**_Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements_**

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, _Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic_ __ _  606)_. The standard provides principles for
recognizing revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers with the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. We elected to adopt ASC 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers, effective as of February 1, 2017. We are
presenting our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended
January 31, 2018 and 2019 under ASC 606\.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, __ _  Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash_, which requires that a statement of cash
flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash
equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted
cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash
and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash
equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total
amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. We retrospectively adopted the
guidance starting February 1, 2017.

**_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_**

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, _Leases (Topic 842)_ , which
supersedes FASB ASC Topic 840, _Leases_ , and makes other conforming
amendments to U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires, among other changes to the
lease accounting guidance, lessees to recognize most leases on-balance sheet
via a right of use asset and lease liability, and additional qualitative and
quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the annual periods in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein,
using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are
required to adopt the standard as of February 1, 2019, and have elected the
transition method that allows us to apply the standard as of the adoption date
and record a cumulative adjustment in accumulated deficit, if applicable. At a
minimum, total assets and total liabilities will increase upon adoption as we
expect to record a right of use asset and a lease liability for our office
space operating leases. We are in the process of concluding certain policy
elections available under Topic 842 and plan to apply the package of practical
expedients under which we have not reassessed whether any expired or existing
contracts are or contain leases, the classification of any expired or existing
leases, or the initial direct costs for any existing leases. See Note 6 to
these consolidated financial statements for details on our current lease
arrangements, the amounts of which represent the future undiscounted
commitments.

In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, _Improvements to Nonemployee
Share-Based Payment Accounting_. The standard simplifies the accounting for
share-based payments granted to nonemployees for goods and services and aligns
most of the guidance on such payments to the nonemployees with the
requirements for share-based payments granted to employees. ASU 2018-07 is
effective for the annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, and interim periods therein, using a modified retrospective approach.
Early

adoption is permitted. We are required to adopt ASU 2018-07 on February 1,
2019. The impact of the adoption of the standard is not expected to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, _Fair Value Measurement
(Topic  820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for
Fair Value Measurement_. The standard no longer requires disclosure of the
amount and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value
hierarchy, however public companies will be required to disclose the range and
weighted-average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3
fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for the annual periods in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein.
Early adoption is permitted. The removed and modified disclosures will be
adopted on a retrospective basis, and the new disclosures will be adopted on a
prospective basis. We are required to adopt ASU 2018-13 on February 1, 2020.
We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2018-13 will have on our
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

We review the individual securities that have unrealized losses on a regular
basis to evaluate whether or not any security has experienced an other-than-
temporary decline in fair value. We evaluate, among other factors, whether we
have the intention to sell any of these marketable securities and whether it
is more likely than not that we will be required to sell any of them before
recovery of the amortized cost basis. Based on the available evidence, we
concluded that the gross unrealized losses on the marketable securities as of
January 31, 2018 and 2019, are temporary in nature. There were no material
realized gains or losses from available-for-sale securities that were
reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss for fiscal 2017, 2018
or 2019.

We classify our highly liquid money market funds within Level 1 of the fair
value hierarchy because they are valued based on quoted market prices in
active markets. We classify our commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate
bonds, U.S. government agency securities, treasury bills and certificate of
deposit within Level 2 because they are valued using inputs other than quoted
prices which are directly or indirectly observable in the market, including
readily-available pricing sources for the identical underlying security which
may not be actively traded. We classify the derivative liabilities as Level 3
due to the lack of relevant observable market data over fair value inputs such
as the probability-weighting of the various scenarios that can impact
settlement of the arrangement. There were no transfers of financial
instruments between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the periods presented.

The following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of
our Level 3 financial instruments as follows:

without approach. Inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of the
derivative instruments include the probability estimates of potential

unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the derivative
instruments associated with the convertible promissory notes are the scenario
probabilities and the discount rate estimated at the valuation date.

**5\. Convertible Promissory Notes**

In October 2018, we entered into a strategic partnership with Dropbox, Inc.
(Dropbox), a global collaboration platform company, which involves the
development of technology enabling integrated workflows for users between our
platform and the Dropbox platform, as well as a strategic partnership with
Atlassian, Inc. (Atlassian), a collaboration software company, which involves
the development of technology enabling integrated workflows for users between
our platform and Atlassians Jira Ops and Jira Service Desk products. As part
of the strategic partnerships, we issued unsecured three-year convertible
promissory notes in the principal amounts of $5.0 million and $10.0 million to
Dropbox and Atlassian, respectively, which accrue simple interest at 2.75% and
5.0% per annum, respectively. Both convertible promissory notes are
collectively referred to as the notes throughout the notes to the
consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise stated. The notes will
automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock upon an IPO at a
conversion price equal to the IPO price. The notes are automatically redeemed
upon the occurrence of a Liquidation Event (defined as (1) the acquisition
of the Company by another entity (other than an acquisition in which holders
of the voting securities outstanding immediately prior to the transaction
retain, immediately after the transaction, at least a majority of the total
voting power), (2) a sale, lease, exclusive license or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the Companys assets by means of a transaction or
series of transactions (other than a sale, lease, exclusive license or other
disposition made to a wholly-owned subsidiary), or (3) any dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary)
for a cash amount equal to 1.2 times the principal plus accrued and unpaid
interest as of the date of the liquidation event. In the event of a Qualified
Financing (defined as a transaction or series of transactions in which we
issue newly-issued preferred stock for aggregate gross proceeds of at least
$25.0 million), the notes will automatically convert into shares of newly-
issued preferred stock at a conversion price equal to 80% of the preferred
stock price. The holders of the notes also have the right, at their option, to
convert the notes into shares of newly-issued preferred stock in a financing
that is not a Qualified Financing at a conversion price equal to 80% of the
preferred stock price.

We concluded that the conversion term on both the Liquidation Event and
Qualified Financing should be bifurcated as embedded derivatives. The impact
of the change in fair value of the derivatives was reported in other income,
net on the consolidated statement of operations. We will remeasure the fair
value of each embedded derivative at each reporting period and recognize the
change in the consolidated statement of operations. The excess of the
principal amount of the Dropbox and Atlassian notes over the liability
component (debt discount) is amortized to interest expense over the
contractual term of the notes at an effective interest rate of 3.22% and
5.39%, respectively. We recorded interest expense of $0.2 million during
fiscal 2019 related to the notes. We present a summary of the changes in the
fair value of our embedded derivatives in Note 3 above.

**6\. Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Operating Leases_**

We lease our office facilities in Australia, China, the United Kingdom and the
United States under noncancelable agreements that expire at various dates
through January 2028. Rent expense during the fiscal year ended January 31,
2017, 2018 and 2019 was $1.6 million, $3.3 million and $7.2 million,
respectively.

Future minimum payments related to operating leases as of January 31, 2019 are

**_Non-cancelable Purchase Obligations _**

In the normal course of business, we enter into non-cancelable purchase
commitments with various parties to purchase primarily software-based
services. As of January 31, 2019, we had outstanding non-cancelable purchase
obligations with a term of 12 months or longer of $25.1 million.

**_Indemnifications and Contingency_**

Our agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions for
indemnifying customers against liabilities if our services infringe a third
partys intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine the
maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and
circumstances that may be involved in each particular agreement. To date, we
have not incurred any material costs as a result of such provisions and have
not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated
financial statements.

In addition, we have indemnification agreements with our directors and our
executive officers that require us, among other things, to indemnify our
directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees,

expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of those
persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is
threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director
or officer, including any action by us, arising out of that persons services
as our director or officer or that persons services provided to any other
company or enterprise at our request. We maintain director and officer
insurance coverage that may enable us to recover a portion of any future
indemnification amounts paid. To date, there have been no claims under any of
our directors and executive officers indemnification provisions.

**_Sales and Other Tax Liabilities_**

We conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions throughout the United States.
In many jurisdictions, non-income-based taxes, such as sales and use tax and
other indirect taxes are assessed on our operations. Although we are diligent
in collecting and remitting such taxes, there is uncertainty as to what
constitutes sufficient in-state presence for a state to levy taxes, fees and
surcharges for sales made over the Internet. As of January 31, 2018 and 2019,
we recorded sales and other tax liabilities of $8.9 million and $22.0 million,
respectively, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million are included in accrued
expenses and other current liabilities, respectively, and $8.4 million and
$20.8 million are included in other liabilities, non-current, respectively, on
our consolidated balance sheets, based on our best estimate of the probable
liability for the loss contingency incurred as of those dates. Our estimate of
a probable outcome under the loss contingency is based on analysis of our
sales and marketing activities, revenue subject to sales tax, and applicable
regulations in applicable jurisdictions in each period. No significant
adjustments to the sales and other tax liabilities have been recognized in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for changes to the assumptions
underlying the estimate. However, changes in our assumptions may occur in the
future as we obtain new information which can result in adjustments to the
recorded liability.

**_Other Contingencies_**

Our platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under
U.S. export control and sanctions laws and regulations, including the U.S.
Department of Commerces Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and various
economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury
Departments Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC). The U.S. export control
laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions or prohibitions on
the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or
sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities, and also require
authorization for the export of certain encryption items. In addition, various
countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including
through import permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted or could
enact laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could
limit our hosts ability to implement our platform in those countries.

Although we take precautions to prevent our platform and associated products
from being accessed or used in violation of such laws, we have inadvertently
allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used by some
customers in apparent violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition,
we may have inadvertently made our software products available to some
customers, including users in embargoed or sanctioned countries, in apparent
violation of the EAR. As a result, we have submitted initial and final
voluntary self-disclosures concerning potential violations of U.S. sanctions
and export control laws and regulations to OFAC and the U.S. Department of
Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security and OFAC. If we are found to be in
violation of U.S. economic sanctions or export control laws, it could result
in fines and penalties. We may also be adversely affected through other
penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets or other
factors. No loss has been recognized in the financial statements for this loss
contingency as it is not probable a loss has been incurred and the range of a
possible loss is not estimable.

**_Legal Proceedings_**

In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject from time to time to
various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes or claims. Although we cannot predict
with assurance the outcome of any litigation, we do not believe there are
currently any such actions that, if resolved unfavorably, would have a
material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

The holders of the convertible preferred stock have the following rights,
preferences and privileges:

_Dividend Rights_  Holders of convertible preferred stock are entitled to
receive noncumulative dividends at the rate of 6% of their applicable original
issue price per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations,
recapitalizations or stock splits), on a pari passu basis when, as, and if,
declared by the board of directors. No dividends will be paid to holders of
common stock until the aforementioned dividends on convertible preferred stock
have been paid or set aside for payment. Any remaining dividends shall be paid
to the holders of convertible preferred stock and common stock on an as-
converted basis. To date, no dividends have been declared.

_Conversion Rights_  Holders of convertible preferred stock have the right to
convert at any time into shares of Class B common stock at the applicable
conversion ratio arrived at by dividing the original issuance price by the
applicable conversion price. All shares of the convertible preferred stock
shall be automatically converted into shares of Class B common stock (i) upon
the written request from holders of each of (a) a majority of the Series A
convertible preferred stock then outstanding, (b) a majority of the Series B
convertible preferred stock then outstanding, (c) a majority of the Series C
convertible preferred stock then outstanding, and (d) a majority of the Series
D convertible preferred stock outstanding, or (ii) into shares of Class B
common stock immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment
underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
in connection with an offering of securities on the New York Stock Exchange,
Nasdaq Global Market or other securities exchange resulting in at least $75.0
million of proceeds (net of underwriting discounts and commissions) at a fully
diluted pre-offering valuation of no less than $1.0 billion.

_Liquidation Preference_  In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of
shares of Series B convertible preferred stock, Series C convertible preferred
stock and Series D convertible preferred stock shall be entitled to receive,
on a pari passu basis, prior and in preference to any distribution from the
proceeds of the liquidation event of the Company to the holders of

Series A convertible preferred stock or common stock by reason of their
ownership thereof, an amount equal to the greater of (i) the applicable
original issue price for such series of convertible preferred stock plus any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or (ii) such amount per share as would
have been payable had all shares of such series of convertible preferred stock
been converted into Class B common stock. After the payment to the holders of
the Series B convertible preferred stock, Series C convertible preferred stock
and Series D convertible preferred stock, the holders of shares of Series A
convertible preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in
preference to any distribution from the proceeds of the liquidation event of
the Company to the holders of common stock by reason of their ownership
thereof, an amount equal to the greater of (i) the applicable original issue
price for the Series A convertible preferred stock plus any dividends declared
but unpaid thereon, or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable
had all shares of Series A convertible preferred stock been converted into
Class B common stock. The remaining funds are distributed with equal priority
and pro rata among the holders of preferred stock and common stock.

_Voting Rights_  The holders of convertible preferred stock are entitled to
vote on all matters and are entitled to the number of votes equal to ten times
the number of shares of Class B common stock into which each share of
convertible preferred stock is then convertible. The holders of convertible
preferred stock vote together with the holders of Class B common stock as a
single class on an as-converted basis, unless as expressly provided in our
certificate of incorporation or as required by law. The holders of Series A
convertible preferred stock, Series B convertible preferred stock, Series C
convertible preferred stock and Series D convertible preferred stock voting as
separate classes, are each entitled to elect one director. In addition, the
holders of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, are entitled to
elect two members of the board of directors. The holders of convertible
preferred stock and Class B common stock, voting together as a single class on
an as-if-converted basis, are entitled to elect remaining members of the board
of directors.

_Redemption_  The convertible preferred stock does not contain any date-
certain redemption features.

_Classification of Convertible Preferred Stock  _ The deemed liquidation
preference provisions of the convertible preferred stock are considered
contingent redemption provisions that are not solely within our control.
Accordingly, the convertible preferred stock has been presented outside of
permanent equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets.

_Repurchases of Convertible Preferred Stock_

In December 2016, in conjunction with the Series D convertible preferred stock
financing, we repurchased 4,000,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred
stock from an existing investor for a total consideration of approximately
$15.0 million. The amount paid in excess of the carrying value of the Series A
convertible preferred stock is considered a deemed dividend and is reflected
as distributed earnings attributable to participating securities in the
calculation of net loss attributable to common stockholders. The shares of
Series A convertible preferred stock that we repurchased were retired
immediately thereafter.

In fiscal 2018, we voluntarily repurchased 1,365,800 shares of Series A
convertible preferred stock from certain existing investors for a total
consideration of $4.6 million. The amount paid in excess of the carrying value
of the Series A convertible preferred stock is considered a deemed dividend
and is reflected as distributed earnings attributable to participating
securities in the calculation of net loss attributable to common stockholders.
The shares of Series A convertible preferred stock that we repurchased were
retired immediately thereafter.

**_Dual Class  Common Stock Structure _**

In November 2018, we implemented a dual class common stock structure pursuant
to which all then-outstanding shares of our common stock were reclassified as
Class B common stock and a new class of Class A

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**



common stock was authorized. The Class A common stock is entitled to one vote
per share and the Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. The
Class A and Class B common stock have the same dividend and liquidation
rights. Each share of Class B common stock will automatically convert into one
share of Class A common stock upon (a) any transfer of such share, except for
certain permitted transfers described in our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation, and (b) the death of the holder of such share. In addition,
each share of Class B common stock will be automatically converted into one
share of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (a) the date that is six
months following the death or incapacity of Eric S. Yuan (our CEO), (b) the
date that is six months following the date that Mr. Yuan is no longer
providing services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (c) the
date specified by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of
convertible preferred stock, voting together on an as-converted basis, and the
holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Class B common stock,
voting as a separate class, and (d) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of
our IPO. In connection with the implementation of the dual class common stock
structure, each then outstanding share of our convertible preferred stock
became convertible into one share of Class B common stock, and all outstanding
options to purchase shares of common stock became options to purchase an
equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock.

Upon the effectiveness of the restated certificate of incorporation in
November 2018, the number of shares of common stock that is authorized to be
issued consisted of 320,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, $0.001 par
value per share and 300,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, $0.001 par
value per share. Class A and Class B common stock are referred to as common
stock throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless
otherwise noted.

**_Equity Incentive Plan_**

In 2011, we adopted the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (2011 Plan), under which
officers, employees, and consultants may be granted various forms of equity
incentive compensation at the discretion of the board of directors, including
stock options and restricted stock awards. The awards have varying terms, but
generally vest over four years, and are issued at the Fair Market Value (as
defined in the 2011 Plan) of the shares of common stock on the date of grant.
Certain awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a Change in Control
(as defined in the 2011 Plan).

As of January 31, 2018 and 2019, our board of directors had authorized
71,240,000 shares of common stock to be reserved for grants of awards under
the 2011 Plan.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted to employees
during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $0.23, $0.67
and $6.28, respectively. As of January 31, 2019, unrecognized stock-based
compensation cost related to outstanding unvested stock options was $57.1
million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
3.4 years.

The Black-Scholes assumptions used to value the employee options at the grant
dates are as follows:



|  |  |  |  |  |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  |    | **Year Ended January  31,**  
  |    | **2017** |    | **2018** |    | **2019**  
  
Expected term (years)

|    | 5.4  6.1 |    | 5.6  6.7 |    | 5.0  6.2  
  
Expected volatility

|    | 48.2%  56.3% |    | 47.7%  52.0% |    | 44.6%  48.2%  
  
Risk-free interest rate

|    | 1.2%  1.5% |    | 1.8%  2.3% |    | 2.6%  3.1%  
  
Expected dividend yield

|    | 0.0% |    | 0.0% |    | 0.0%  
  
These assumptions and estimates were determined as follows:



  |  |   |

_Fair Value of Common Stock._ As our common stock is not publicly traded, the
fair value was determined by our board of directors, with input from
management and valuation reports prepared by third-party valuation
specialists. Stock-based compensation for financial reporting purposes is
measured based on updated estimates of fair value when appropriate, such as
when additional relevant information related to the estimate becomes available
in a valuation report issued as of a subsequent date.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

_Risk-Free Interest Rate._ The risk-free interest rate for the expected term
of the options was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
time of the grant. __  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


F-28

##### Table of Contents

**ZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS, INC.**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**



  |  |   |

_Expected Term._ The expected term of options represents the period of time
that options are expected to be outstanding. Our historical stock option
exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate
an expected term due to a lack of sufficient data. For stock options granted
to employees, we estimate the expected term by using the simplified method.
The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-
to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. For stock options granted
to non-employees, the expected term equals the contractual term of the option.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

_Expected Volatility._ As we do not have a trading history for our common
stock, the expected volatility was estimated by taking the average historic
price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public companies in
our industry that are either similar in size, stage of life cycle, or
financial leverage, over a period equivalent to the expected term of the
awards.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  


  |  |   |

_Expected Dividend Yield._ We have never declared or paid any cash dividends
and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As
a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.  
  
---|---|---|---  
  
**_Early Exercise of Common Stock Options_**

Our board of directors authorized certain stock option holders to exercise
unvested options to purchase shares of common stock. Shares received from such
early exercises are subject to repurchase in the event of the optionees
termination of service as a Service Provider (as defined in the 2011 Plan), at
the original issuance price, until the options are fully vested. As of January
31, 2018 and 2019, 1,941,667 and 1,261,230 shares of Class B common stock were
subject to repurchase at a weighted average price of $0.26 and $1.41 per
share, respectively. As of January 31, 2018 and 2019, the cash proceeds
received for unvested shares of common stock recorded within accrued expenses
and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets were $0.5
million and $1.8 million, respectively.

**_Restricted Stock Award_**

In October 2015, we issued 1,202,720 shares of common stock to a member of our
board of directors under a restricted stock agreement at a grant date fair
value of $0.14 per share, totaling $0.2 million. Of the total shares issued,
481,088 shares vested on the grant date and the remaining shares vest over
four years from the grant date. The unvested shares are subject to a
repurchase right held by us at the original purchase price.

For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, 180,408 shares of
the restricted common stock vested in each period, and the related stock-based
compensation expense for such shares of common stock was immaterial. As of
January 31, 2019, 180,408 shares of common stock were unvested and subject to
repurchase.

**_Third-Party Stock Transactions_**

In May 2017, our CEO sold 2,899,136 shares of our common stock to an existing
investor at a per share price of $3.74. In the consolidated statements of
operations for fiscal 2018, due to the fact that the purchase was made by an
economic interest holder and is presumptively considered compensatory under
U.S. GAAP, we recognized stock-based compensation expense related to such
stock sale of $8.6 million, the difference between the purchase price and the
fair value of our common stock at the time of sale.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax
legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The
Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affect
fiscal 2018, including, but not limited to, requiring a one-time transition
tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable
over eight years (Transition Tax) and a reduction in the corporate tax rate to
21%. The Tax Act also establishes new tax laws that will affect later years, a
general limitation of U.S.

federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, net operating
loss deduction limitations, a base erosion, anti-tax abuse tax (BEAT) and a
deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) and a new provision
designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). Under ASC 740, the
effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which
the new legislation is enacted. In the case of U.S. federal income taxes, the
enactment date is the date the bill becomes law. We do not expect a financial
statement impact as a result of this legislation. We performed a re-
measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the decrease
in the corporate federal income tax rate to 21%, which was offset by the
valuation allowance. We have elected to treat taxes on GILTI as period costs
starting in the current year.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118
(SAB 118) which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax
Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one
year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting
under ASC 740, Income taxes. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must
reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the
accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a companys
accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it
is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional
estimate in the financial statements. As of January 31, 2019, no provisional
estimate had been recorded as we have completed our accounting under the Tax
Act.

Our accounting for the following elements of the Tax Act is complete:
Reduction of U.S. federal Corporate Tax Rate: The Tax Act reduces the
corporate tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Accordingly, we have re-
measured all deferred taxes at 21% as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a
decrease related to the net deferred tax asset balance of $0.9 million with a
corresponding net adjustment to our valuation allowance. We expect that the
U.S. Treasury will issue regulations and other guidance on the application of
certain provisions of the Tax Act. We will analyze that guidance and other
necessary information to refine our estimates and complete our accounting for
the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, as necessary.

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying
the statutory federal tax rate as follows:

Deferred income taxes result from differences in the recognition of expenses
for tax and financial reporting purposes, as well as operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. Significant components of our deferred income tax assets
as of January 31, 2018 and 2019 are as follows:

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management
believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be
realized; accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established on U.S. net
deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance decreased by $3.1 million and
$2.3 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2019,
respectively.

As of January 31, 2019, we had net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $26.9 million for federal income tax purposes which will begin
to expire in 2032 if unused. We had net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $10.7 million for state income tax purposes which will begin to
expire in the year 2027 if unused.

As of January 31, 2019, we also had research and development credit
carryforwards of approximately $1.1 million for federal income tax and $1.1
million for state income tax purposes. The federal research and development
tax credit will begin to expire in 2036 if unused. State research and
development tax credits carryforward indefinitely.

The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to
significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar provisions under state law. The
Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit the federal net
operating loss carryforwards that may be used in any given year in the event
of special occurrences, including significant ownership changes. We have
completed a Section 382 calculation and have determined that none of the
operating losses will expire solely due to Section 382 limitation(s).

We comply with ASC 740-10, _Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes_ which
prescribes a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure in financial statements of any uncertain tax
positions that have been taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. In
2011, we adopted the provisions set forth in ASC 740-10, issued originally as
FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This
pronouncement sets a more likely than not criterion for recognizing the tax
benefit of

uncertain tax positions. Total unrecognized income tax benefits were $2.8
million as of January 31, 2019. We do not anticipate any significant changes
to unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. We recognize interest and
penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax
position is as follows:

Tax Benefits** |

|  
  
Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized
tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. During the fiscal years
ended January 31, 2018 and 2019, we recognized no interest and penalties
associated with unrecognized tax benefits. There are no tax positions for
which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax
benefits will significantly increase or decrease within 12 months of the
reporting date. If recognized, $1.0 million would affect our effective tax
rate.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state
jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. As of January 31, 2019, all
of the years remain open to examination by the federal and state tax
authorities for three or four years from the tax year in which net operating
losses or tax credits are utilized. There have been no examinations of our
income tax returns by any tax authority.

The convertible promissory notes are contingently convertible (convertible
upon completion of an IPO or a qualified financing event as discussed in Note
5), and the conditions for the convertible feature were not satisfied as of
January 31, 2019. We have excluded these potential dilutive shares from the
calculation of diluted net income per share attributable to common
stockholders for the period.

Basic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they
are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.

**_Unaudited Pro Forma Net Income Per Share Attributable to Common
Stockholders_**

We have presented the unaudited pro forma basic and diluted net income per
share for fiscal 2019, which has been computed to give effect to the
conversion of our convertible preferred stock into Class B common stock and
conversion of convertible promissory notes into Class A common stock (using
the if-converted method) as though the conversion had occurred as of the
beginning of the period or the original date of issuance, if later. The pro
forma net income per share does not include shares being offered in the
assumed IPO.

In November 2015, we provided a loan under a full recourse promissory note to
our CEO in the amount of $2.0 million. The promissory note had a term of six
months and bore interest at a rate that is the greater of (i) 4% per annum,
compounded annually and (ii) the Applicable Federal Rate (as set by the
Internal Revenue Service), per annum, compounded annually. In March 2016, our
CEO repaid the note receivable principal balance of $2.0 million and an
immaterial amount of accrued interest.

22, 2019, the date at which the consolidated financial statements were
available to be issued.

Subsequent to January 31, 2019, we granted stock options to purchase up to
760,700 shares of Class B common stock with a weighted-average exercise price
of $24.10 per share.

Subsequent to January 31, 2019, we entered into an agreement to lease
additional space and extend the term of existing leases located in the United
States. We expect to make $14.0 million of additional rent payments over the
term of these leases, which expires during the year ending January 31, 2030.

**12\. Events (Unaudited) Subsequent to the Date of the Report of the
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

Subsequent to March 22, 2019, we granted stock options to purchase up to
573,950 shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of
$31.85 per share. All options granted after January 31, 2019 generally vest
over a period of 48 months. Based on the initial public offering price, we
estimate we will recognize approximately $29.0 million of stock-based
compensation expense related to these stock options granted after January 31,
2019 generally over the requisite service period of 48 months.

In addition, in light of the difference between the fair value used for stock
options granted on January 24, 2019 and the initial public offering price, in
order to determine the appropriate share-based compensation expense for those
stock options for financial reporting purposes, we reassessed the share-based
compensation expense using the initial public offering price. We are
recognizing $19.3 million of stock-based compensation expense related to these
option grants generally over the requisite service period of 48 months. Since
these options were granted near the end of fiscal 2019, the amount of stock-
based compensation expense recognized in that fiscal period for these stock
option grants is immaterial, and the incremental amount of additional expense
in fiscal 2019 as a result of this reassessment using the initial public
offering price is also immaterial. Therefore, we will record an out-of-period
adjustment in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to catch-up the incremental
amount of additional expense for these stock option grants that would have
otherwise been recorded in fiscal 2019.

In April 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement with Salesforce Ventures
LLC to purchase $100.0 million of our Class A common stock in a private
placement at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price. The
purchase of our Class A common stock will occur immediately subsequent to the
closing of our initial public offering.
